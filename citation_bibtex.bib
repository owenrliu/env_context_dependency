abstract = {Ecological management and decision-making typically focus on uncertainty about the future, but surprisingly little is known about how to account for uncertainty of the present: that is, the realities of having only partial or imperfect measurements. Our primary paradigms for handling decisions under uncertainty—the precautionary principle and optimal control—have so far given contradictory results. This paradox is best illustrated in the example of fisheries management, where many ideas that guide thinking about ecological decision-making were first developed. We find that simplistic optimal control approaches have repeatedly concluded that a manager should increase catch quotas when faced with greater uncertainty about the fish biomass. Current best practices take a more precautionary approach, decreasing catch quotas by a fixed amount to account for uncertainty. Using comparisons to both simulated and historical catch data, we find that neither approach is sufficient to avoid stock collapses under moderate observational uncertainty. Using partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) methods, we demonstrate how this paradox arises from flaws in the standard theory, which contributes to overexploitation of fisheries and increased probability of economic and ecological collapse. In contrast, we find that POMDP-based management avoids such overexploitation while also generating higher economic value. These results have significant implications for how we handle uncertainty in both fisheries and ecological management more generally.},

abstract = {Current and future prospects for successfully rebuilding global fisheries remain debated due to uncertain stock status, variable management success, and disruptive environmental change. While scientists routinely account for some of this uncertainty in population models, the mechanisms by which this translates into decision-making and policy are problematic and can lead to unintentional overexploitation. Here, we explicitly track the role of measurement uncertainty and environmental variation in the decision-making process for setting catch quotas. Analyzing 109 well-sampled stocks from all oceans, we show that current practices may attain 55{\%} recovery on average, while richer decision methods borrowed from robotics yield 85{\%} recovery of global stocks by midcentury, higher economic returns, and greater robustness to environmental surprises. These results challenge the consensus that global fisheries can be rebuilt by existing approaches alone, while also underscoring that rebuilding stocks may still be achieved by improved decision-making tools that optimally manage this uncertainty.},

@article{VanDerHeide2007,
abstract = {Abstract Seagrasses are threatened by human activity in many locations around the world. Their decline is often characterized by sudden ecosystem collapse from a vegetated to a bare state. In the 1930s, such a dramatic event happened in the Dutch Wadden Sea. Before the shift, large seagrass beds (Zostera marina) were present in this area. After the construction of a large dam and an incidence of the wasting disease in the early 1930s, these meadows became virtually extinct and never recovered despite restoration attempts. We investigated whether this shift could be explained as a critical transition between alternative stable states, and whether the lack of recovery could be due to the high resilience of the new turbid state. We analyzed the depth distribution of the historical meadows, a long-term dataset of key factors determining turbidity and a minimal model based on these data. Results demonstrate that recovery was impossible because turbidity related to suspended sediment was too high, probably because turbidity was no longer reduced by seagrass itself. Model simulations on the positive feedback suggest indeed the robust occurrence of alternative stable states and a high resilience of the current turbid state. As positive feedbacks are common in seagrasses, our findings may explain both the worldwide observed collapses and the low success rate of restoration attempts of seagrass habitats. Therefore, appreciation of ecosystem resilience may be crucial in seagrass ecosystem management.},

abstract = {Synchronous variations in the abundance of geographically distinct marine fish populations are known to occur across spatial scales on the order of 1,000 km and greater. The prevailing assumption is that this large-scale coherent variability is a response to coupled atmosphere– ocean dynamics, commonly represented by climate indexes, such as the AtlanticMultidecadal Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation. On the other hand, it has been suggested that exploitationmight contrib- ute to this coherent variability. This possibility has been generally ignored or dismissed on the grounds that exploitation is unlikely to operate synchronously at such large spatial scales. Our analysis of adult fishing mortality and spawning stock biomass of 22 North At- lantic cod (Gadusmorhua) stocks revealed that both the temporal and spatial scales in fishing mortality and spawning stock biomass were equivalent to those of the climate drivers. From these results, we conclude that greater consideration must be given to the potential of exploitation as a driving force behind broad, coherent variability of heavily exploited fish species.},

abstract = {Due primarily to wolf predation on livestock (depredation), some groups oppose wolf (Canis lupus) conservation in the Northwestern U.S., which is an objective for large sectors of the public. Livestock depredation by wolves is a cost of wolf conservation borne by livestock producers, which creates conflict between producers, wolves and organizations involved in wolf conservation and management. Compensation is the main tool used to mitigate the costs of depredation, but this tool may be limited at improving tolerance for wolves. Furthermore, livestock production may in fact provide indirectly an important benefit for wolf conservation - i.e. a positive externality, by maintaining relatively intact habitat on private lands. We analyzed some of the costs of livestock depredation by wolves to livestock producers relative to recent economic trends in the livestock production industry, specifically income generated from livestock production and trends in land and livestock value. Data were gathered from depredation investigations, from the livestock compensation program and on land and livestock price in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, U.S.A. from 1987 to 2003 - a period during which wolves had endangered species status. We found that instigation of attacks on livestock by wolves was determined by need for food, but wolves may kill sheep in excess of food needs. Excessive killing of livestock may contribute significantly to intolerance for wolves. Livestock killed by wolves cost producers approximately {\$}11,076.49 per year between 1987 and 2003, although costs were increasing linearly (R2= 0.789, P {\textless} 0.001). Each year such costs accounted for {\textless} 0.01{\%} of the annual gross income from livestock operations in the region. Thus, wolf depredation is a small economic cost to the industry, although it may be a significant cost to affected producers as these costs are not equitably distributed across the industry. Compensation for depredation was efficient when compared to other regions. Land prices increased steadily throughout the study period (R2= 0.966, P {\textless} 0.001), while the price of cattle decreased (R2= 0.749, P {\textless} 0.001). We maintain that conservation groups should consider the potential consequences of all of these economic trends. Specifically, declining cattle price and the steady increase in land price might induce conversion of agricultural land to rural-residential developments, which could negatively impact wolf conservation via large scale habitat change and increased human presence. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Understanding marine ecosystem dynamics is a key challenge and opportunity facing us. One of the ways we can continue to unravel and understand marine ecosystem dynamics is via ecosystem modeling. We used one such model, ATLANTIS, to help explore the dynamics of the Northeast United States (NEUS) Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (LME). We have parameterized ATLANTIS for the NEUS LME by including major functional groups across a range of biota, the physiographic dynamics of the ecosystem, and the major fishing fleets. The objectives of this work were to describe the application of this ATLANTIS NEUS model; briefly highlight modeling skill; note areas for further improvement, data gaps, major lessons learned, and how our understanding of the ecosystem was enhanced as we executed the modeling process; and note how these model outputs could inform living marine resource management in this region. The preliminary results we show here describe outputs from a multivariate, multispecies, multifactorial modeling approach. Our modeling skill is reasonable, as determined by the fact that over 90{\%} of our fleet effort estimates, nearly 80{\%} of our functional group catches, and 100{\%} of our main functional group biomasses were within limits of tolerance. Moreover, the general patterns and phenology of major events were replicated consistently, both in space and time across a broad suite of physical, chemical, biological and human factors. These include several taxa groups such as primary producers, zooplankton, benthos, fishes, marine mammals, as well as nutrients, landings, and fishing effort. Conversely, as expected, there were some groups or fleets that did exceed levels of tolerance. These were mostly invertebrate groups such as shrimp, squid or gelatinous zooplankton, groups which are notorious for being difficult to model. Yet the major taxa groups and main fishing fleets were all well within levels of tolerance. Thus, we assert that with the majority of all main processes and state variables simulated, this ATLANTIS model can indeed reasonably approximate observations for the NEUS LME across a range of factors, and more importantly can be used to evaluate the relative prominence across a range of factors that contribute to the dynamics of this marine ecosystem. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {We consider the question of which quantitative modelling tools can be used to support an ecosystem approach to management (EAM), with a focus on evaluating the implication of decisions on the biological system being managed. Managers of federal fisheries in the eastern Bering Sea, USA, have adopted an EAM. The tools used to support EAM in the eastern Bering Sea serve as a guide to what types of models could be used elsewhere. A review of the role of natural science in the implementation of EAM shows that scientific advice enters into decision-making at a variety of steps. Single-species stock assessment and projection models are the most commonly used tools employed to inform managers. Comprehensive assessments (e.g. management strategy evaluation) are emerging as a new and potentially valuable analysis technique for use in assessing trade-offs of different strategic alternatives. In the case of management in the eastern Bering Sea, end-to-end models and coupled biophysical models have been used primarily to advance scientific understanding, but have not been applied in a management context. This review highlights that implementation of an EAM in a management environment such as eastern Bering Sea requires substantial commitments to the collection and analysis of data and support for a group of analysts with interdisciplinary training in population dynamics, oceanography and ecology. This review supports the growing recognition that a diverse suite of modelling tools is needed to address tactical and strategic management issues germane to the adoption of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management.},

@article{Dayton1984,
abstract = {This paper considers 3 concepts of stability as they relate to the dynamics of distinctive patch types of algal canopy guilds in southern and central California kelp communities: persistence of a patch through more than 1 generation of the dominant species, which was evaluated by using life tables and observations of patch borders; inertia or the resistance of different patches to invasion or disturbance, which was evaluated by artificially enhancing gametophytes by transplanting sporogenic material, by removing canopy, and by evaluating some important disturbance processes; and resilience or recoverability of a patch following a perturbation sufficient to allow invasion of different species, which was studied by defining some of the mechanisms of successful invasion or succession. By working in distinct habitats in sourthern (Pt. Loma and Santa Catalina Island) and central (Pt. Piedras Blancas) California, different types of physical stresses as they related to these stability concepts could be evaluated. Taller perennial canopy guilds were dominant competitors for light, but were more susceptible to physical wave stress. Dominance hierarchies in the competition for light appeared to be reversed in areas exposed to increasing wave stress. The main causes of mortality at Pt. Loma were entanglement with storm-dislodged Macrocystis plants and, in some areas, sea urchin grazing. Mortality in central California was due to winter storms. In most cases, distinct patches resisted invasion for {\textgreater} 10 yr. The mechanisms of resistance involved (1) competition for light and, possibly, nutrients, and (2) limits to spore dispersal. When succession occurred, it was often mediated by many factors, including seasonality of spore production, which coincided with winter storm-related mortalities; mechanisms of kelp dispersal, which were most effective via drifting plants and fragments of fertile material held against the substrate by invertebrates; and survivorship of gametophytes and small sporophytes, which was influenced by local scour and grazing. Appropriate spatial scales, stability, and succession studies in these kelp communities were determined by the size of the disturbed area, which varied from the free space resulting from detachment of single plants to the free space resulting from catastrophies such as overgrazing or unusual storms. Temporal scales were influenced by seasonality of disturbance and algal reproductive condition and aperiodic episodes of cool, nutrient-rich water advected into the patch. There appeared to be conflicting morphological adaptations of the canopy guilds: exploitation of light was enhanced at higher canopy levels, whereas the lower canopy levels were better adapted to tolerate stress from wave surge. The adaptations of the algae appeared to form 4 distinct groups of tactics: ruderals or plants, such as Nereocystis and Desmarestia, with opportunistic life histories; kelps, such as Macrocystis, adapted to exploitative competition for light and nutrients; kelps (Eisenia, Dictyoneurum) adapted to physical stress such as wave surge; and those algae, such as corallines and Agarum, adapted to heavy grazing. Within any given area, the relative patch stability was determined by biological relationships; between areas, the patch stability patterns were attributable to physical differences.},

Less is known about the importance of context-dependence in symbioses involved in wildlife disease. We review variable symbioses, and use the amphibian disease chytridiomycosis to demonstrate how understanding context-dependence can improve the understanding and management of wildlife diseases. In chytridiomycosis, the host-pathogen interaction is context-dependent; it is strongly affected by environmental temperature. Skin bacteria can also modify the interaction; some bacteria reduce amphibians' susceptibility to chytridiomycosis. Augmentation of protective microbes is being considered as a possible management tool, but informed application of bioaugmentation requires understanding of how the interactions between host, beneficial bacteria and pathogen depend upon environmental context. The community-level response of the amphibian skin microbiota to environmental conditions may explain the relatively narrow range of environmental conditions in which past declines have occurred. Environmental context affects virulence and the protection provided by mutualists in other host-pathogen systems, including threatened bats and corals. Increased focus on context-dependence in interactions between wildlife and their symbionts is likely to be crucial to the future investigation and management of emerging diseases of wildlife.},

abstract = {Kelps are ecologically important primary producers and ecosystem engineers, and play a central role in structuring nearshore temperate habitats. They play an important role in nutrient cycling, energy capture and transfer, and provide biogenic coastal defence. Kelps also provide extensive substrata for colonising organisms, ameliorate conditions for understorey assemblages, and provide three-dimensional habitat structure for a vast array of marine plants and animals, including a number of commercially important species. Here, we review and synthesize existing knowledge on the functioning of kelp species as biogenic habitat providers. We examine biodiversity patterns associated with kelp holdfasts, stipes and blades, as well as the wider understorey habitat, and search for generality between kelp species and biogeographic regions. Environmental factors influencing biogenic habitat provision and the structure of associated assemblages are considered, as are current threats to kelp-dominated ecosystems. Despite considerable variability between species and regions, kelps are key habitat-forming species that support elevated levels of biodiversity, diverse and abundant assemblages and facilitate trophic linkages. Enhanced appreciation and better management of kelp forests are vital for ensuring sustainability of ecological goods and services derived from temperate marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {Fisheries can have a large impact on marine ecosystems, because the effects of removing large predatory fish may cascade down the food web. The implications of these cascading processes on system functioning and resilience remain a source of intense scientific debate. By using field data covering a 30-year period, we show for the Baltic Sea that the underlying mechanisms of trophic cascades produced a shift in ecosystem functioning after the collapse of the top predator cod. We identified an ecological threshold, corresponding to a planktivore abundance of 17 1010 individuals, that separates 2 ecosystem configurations in which zooplankton dynamics are driven by either hydroclimatic forces or predation pressure. Abundances of the planktivore sprat above the threshold decouple zooplankton dynamics from hydrological circumstances. The current strong regulation by sprat of the feeding resources for larval cod may hinder cod recovery and the return of the ecosystem to a prior state. This calls for the inclusion of a food web perspective in management decisions.},

abstract = {While much of traditional fisheries theory has concentrated on maximum or optimum yield, the reality of fisheries management is that biomass yield is only one of the several indicators of fisheries performance, and desired outcomes generally only need to provide something near the maximum possible yield. A range of policies are explored to find those that produce "Pretty Good Yield" defined as sustainable yield at least 80{\%} of the maximum sustainable yield. Such yields are generally obtained over a broad range of stock sizes (20-50{\%} of unfished stock abundance), and this range is not sensitive to the population's basic life history parameters such as natural mortality rate, somatic growth rate, or age at maturity. The most important biological parameter determining this range is the intensity of recruitment compensation. Meta-analysis shows compensation is usually strong and there is reasonably little yield lost at what are now widely accepted definitions of overfishing or risk for most stocks. Similarly, maintaining stocks at 50{\%} of unfished stock abundance for ecological or economic reasons results in little expected loss of yield. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Atlantic cod Gadus morhua population off Newfoundland collapsed in the early 1990s due to over-exploitation, and despite marked reduction in fishing effort the stock remains depressed. Harp seal Pagophilus groenlandicus predation has been repeatedly proposed as an explanation for this lack of recovery, but other hypotheses include reduced prey availability and/or food quality (i.e. lack of capelin Mallotus villosus), as well as fisheries catches and environ- mental effects. Using a bioenergetics−allometric model, we gauged the relative contributions of these drivers on the lack of recovery and dynamics of the northern cod stock. Biomass dynamics were best explained by a combination of fisheries removals and capelin availability, whereas seal consumption was found not to be an important driver of the northern cod stock. Prey availability was linked to reduced somatic condition during the 1990s and 2000s. We discuss evidence that suggests that cod may be experiencing depensatory dynamics, but not related to a ‘predator pit effect'. Our study suggests that trophic control is bottom-up, and that a depressed capelin stock could be a serious impediment for cod rebuilding.},

abstract = {In ecosystems that are strongly structured by predation, reducing top predator abundance can alter several lower trophic levels—a process known as a trophic cascade. A persistent trophic cascade also fits the definition of a regime shift. Such ‘trophic cascade regime shifts' have been reported in a few pelagic marine systems—notably the Black Sea, Baltic Sea and eastern Scotian Shelf—raising the question of how common this phenomenon is in the marine environment. We provide a general methodology for distinguish- ing top-down and bottom-up effects and apply this methodology to time series from these three ecosystems. We found evidence for top-down forcing in the Black Sea due primarily to gelatinous zooplankton. Changes in the Baltic Sea are primarily bottom-up, strongly structured by salinity, but top- down forcing related to changes in cod abundance also shapes the ecosystem. Changes in the eastern Scotian Shelf thatwere originally attributed to declines in groundfish are better explained by changes in stratification. Our review suggests that trophic cascade regime shifts are rare in open ocean ecosystems and that their likelihood increases as the residence time ofwater in the system increases. Our work challenges the assumption that negative correlation between consecutive trophic levels implies top-down forcing},

Unfortunately, it is very difficult to measure ecological resilience in practice. Here we show that the rate of recovery from small perturbations (sometimes called “engineering resilience”) is a remarkably good indicator of ecological resilience. Such recovery rates decrease as a catastrophic regime shift is approached, a phenomenon known in physics as “critical slowing down.” We demonstrate the robust occurrence of critical slowing down in six ecological models and outline a possible experimental approach to quantify differences in recovery rates. In all the models we analyzed, critical slowing down becomes apparent quite far from a threshold point, suggesting that it may indeed be of practical use as an early warning signal.

abstract = {I investigated demography and foraging behavior of the southern sea otter (Enyhdra lutris nereis), in order to examine the individual and population-level consequences of alternative foraging strategies, and to evaluate the importance of food-limitation as a factor limiting population growth. I developed a maximum likelihood-based analytical method to estimate historical age/sex-specific vital rates, and spatial/temporal variation in vital rates, using carcass age-structure and population census databases. To estimate current demographic trends I conducted a mark-recapture study, measuring survival and reproduction of 115 radio-tagged study animals between 2001 and 2004. Together, these analyses indicate that survival has decreased substantially between the early 1990s and the present, and is lowest in the north-central portion of the sea otter's range. The greatest decrease was for adult ({\textgreater} 4 years of age) females: variation in survival of this age/sex class is primarily responsible for regulating population growth and driving population trends. I also collected foraging data from 60 marked sea otters, and found pronounced individual dietary specialization (greater than that reported previously). Cluster analysis indicated that individual diets could be grouped into three general “diet types”; differences in foraging behavior between these diet types suggest that they represent distinct foraging strategies. The rate of energy gain while foraging was low for the population as a whole, but showed a high degree of variation. Foraging strategies differed with respect to mean energy gain; however, because the mean and within-animal variation in rate of energy gain were positively correlated, all three strategies result in similar probabilities of exceeding a critical rate of energy gain on any given day, and there is likely a trade-off between the mean and variance in the rate of energy gain. Correlational selection is also important in maintaining multiple foraging strategies within the population: a multivariate fitness surface fit to foraging behavior indicates multiple fitness peaks corresponding to alternative foraging strategies. I suggest that food-limitation is likely an important ultimate factor restricting population growth in the center of the sea otters' range in California, but that the existence of alternative foraging strategies may obscure expected patterns of density dependence.},

abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative condition caused by expansion of the polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin (Htt) protein. Neuronal toxicity in HD is thought to be, at least in part, a consequence of protein interactions involving mutant Htt. We therefore hypothesized that genetic modifiers of HD neurodegeneration should be enriched among Htt protein interactors. To test this idea, we identified a comprehensive set of Htt interactors using two complementary approaches: high-throughput yeast two-hybrid screening and affinity pull down followed by mass spectrometry. This effort led to the identification of 234 high-confidence Htt-associated proteins, 104 of which were found with the yeast method and 130 with the pull downs. We then tested an arbitrary set of 60 genes encoding interacting proteins for their ability to behave as genetic modifiers of neurodegeneration in a Drosophila model of HD. This high-content validation assay showed that 27 of 60 orthologs tested were high-confidence genetic modifiers, as modification was observed with more than one allele. The 45{\%} hit rate for genetic modifiers seen among the interactors is an order of magnitude higher than the 1{\%}-4{\%} typically observed in unbiased genetic screens. Genetic modifiers were similarly represented among proteins discovered using yeast two-hybrid and pull-down/mass spectrometry methods, supporting the notion that these complementary technologies are equally useful in identifying biologically relevant proteins. Interacting proteins confirmed as modifiers of the neurodegeneration phenotype represent a diverse array of biological functions, including synaptic transmission, cytoskeletal organization, signal transduction, and transcription. Among the modifiers were 17 loss-of-function suppressors of neurodegeneration, which can be considered potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Finally, we show that seven interacting proteins from among 11 tested were able to co-immunoprecipitate with full-length Htt from mouse brain. These studies demonstrate that high-throughput screening for protein interactions combined with genetic validation in a model organism is a powerful approach for identifying novel candidate modifiers of polyglutamine toxicity.},

While the full governing equations of these systems are typically unknown due to insufficient understanding of their internal mechanisms, there is often interest in determining the leading element. Here, the leading element is defined as the sub-system with the largest coupling coefficient averaged over a selected time span. Previously, the Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM) method has been employed to determine causality and dominant component in weakly coupled systems with constant coupling coefficients. In this study, CCM is applied to a pair of coupled Lorenz systems with time-varying coupling coefficients, exhibiting switching between dominant sub-systems in different periods. Four sets of numerical experiments are carried out. The first three cases consist of different coupling coefficient schemes: I) Periodic-constant, II) Normal, and III) Mixed Normal/Non-normal. In case IV, numerical experiment of cases II and III are repeated with imposed temporal uncertainties as well as additive normal noise. Our results show that, through detecting directional interactions, CCM identifies the leading sub-system in all cases except when the average coupling coefficients are approximately equal, i.e., when the dominant sub-system is not well defined.},

abstract = {We studied the effects of grazing by two species of sea urchins on two species of kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera and Pterygophora californica) in the San Onofre kelp bed in southern California from 1978 through 1981. Both red sea urchins, Strongylocentrotus franciscanus, and white sea urchins, Lytechinus anamesus, were abundant and lived in aggregations. The purple sea urchin (S. purpuratus) was rare at the study site and was not studied. The aggregations of red urchins were either relatively small and stationary (for over 3 yr) or relatively large and motile (advancing at about 2 m mo-1). Both stationary and moving aggregations were observed at the same time, and within 100 m of one another. Stationary aggregations of red urchins probably subsisted mainly on drift kelp and had no effect on kelp recruitment or on adult kelp abundance. In contrast, red sea urchins in large, motile aggregations or ``fronts'' ate almost all the macroalgae in their path. The condition of their gonalds indicated that red urchins in fronts were starved relative to red urchins in the small, stationary aggregations. Large, motile aggregations developed after 2 yr of declining kelp abundance (probably due largely to storms). We propose that a scarcity of drift algae for food results in a change in the behavior pattern of the red urchins and thus leads to the formation of large, motile aggregations. The aggregations of white urchins, which occurred along the offshore margin of the kelp bed, were large, but relatively stationary. The white urchins rarely ate adult kelps, but grazed extensively on early developmental stages of kelps and evidently prevented seaward expansion of the bed. The spatial distribution of both types of red urchin aggregations appeared to be unrelated to predation pressure from fishes or lobsters.},

At hotter southern sites, particularly in bays, high intertidal barnacle survivorship was enhanced by experimental shading or by neighbors which ameliorate heat and desiccation stresses. In contrast, at cooler northern bay and coastal sites, neither shading nor group benefits increased barnacle survival, and mortality patterns were driven primarily by predators with largely boreal distributions.

A recent large-scale warming event in the North Pacific Ocean of unprecedented magnitude and duration allowed us to evaluate the sentinel status of giant kelp, a coastal foundation species that thrives in cold, nutrient-rich waters and is considered sensitive to warming. Here, we show that giant kelp and the majority of species that associate with it did not presage ecosystem effects of extreme warming off southern California despite giant kelp's expected vulnerability. Our results challenge the general perception that kelp-dominated systems are highly vulnerable to extreme warming events and expose the more general risk of relying on supposed sentinel species that are assumed to be very sensitive to climate change.},

abstract = {Marine aquaculture presents an opportunity for increasing seafood production in the face of growing demand for marine protein and limited scope for expanding wild fishery harvests. However, the global capacity for increased aquaculture production from the ocean and the relative productivity potential across countries are unknown. Here, we map the biological production potential for marine aquaculture across the globe using an innovative approach that draws from physiology, allometry and growth theory. Even after applying substantial constraints based on existing ocean uses and limitations, we find vast areas in nearly every coastal country that are suitable for aquaculture. The development potential far exceeds the space required to meet foreseeable seafood demand; indeed, the current total landings of all wild-capture fisheries could be produced using less than 0.015{\%} of the global ocean area. This analysis demonstrates that suitable space is unlikely to limit marine aquaculture development and highlights the role that other factors, such as economics and governance, play in shaping growth trajectories. We suggest that the vast amount of space suitable for marine aquaculture presents an opportunity for countries to develop aquaculture in a way that aligns with their economic, environmental and social objectives. Marine aquaculture has the potential to improve food security. A global analysis shows that space in coastal areas is unlikely to limit the potential for aquaculture.},

Size-frequency distribution analysis showed that females can reach maturity at four different instars, presumably Instars VIII to XI. Geographic variation in instar structure generates clinal variation in size at maturity, from small size at high latitudes (colder) to large size at low latitudes (warmer). Different pieces of evidence support the hypothesis that geographic variation in mature female size is a phenotypic response to environmental conditions governed by a single reaction norm. Clinal variation conforms to the ‘‘inverse Bergmann's rule''. We argue that a single macroecological rule should not be expected to explain all latitudinal size gradients observed in marine invertebrates. Size at maturity fluctuated cyclically, and was negatively and significantly cross-correlated with strength in the recruitment of females to the mature population. Cycles in the latter were manifested as four commensurate and regularly spaced pulses over the last three decades. Mechanisms that may underlay this intriguing phenomenon, including density-dependent growth rate, require further scrutiny.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Understanding the impacts of climate change on biological systems requires observational data over multi-decadal time spans and broad spatial scales. Extensive research at an ocean warming hotspot off Nova Scotia, Canada, enabled us to evaluate the impact of 3 decades of observed temperature rise on a coastal marine ecosystem. Here, we document changes in the kelp community from sites monitored since 1949, 1968 and 1984, and from coastal surveys in 1982, 2000, 2007 and 2014. We show that mean kelp biomass has declined by 85-99{\%} over the past 4-6 decades, and a catastrophic phase shift has occurred from luxuriant kelp beds to rocky reefs dominated by opportunistic turf-forming and invasive algae. This shift likely represents a persistent change, driven by multiple biotic and abiotic interactions, with positive feedback mechanisms (e.g. sediment accumulation) that stabilize the invasive/turf-algal state. This study is the first to show multi-decadal declines in kelp related to warming temperatures in the Northwest Atlantic. The large-scale degradation of an important coastal ecosystem within a warming hotspot presents a troubling example of the instability of marine systems in a rapidly changing ocean environment.},

abstract = {* Changing climate is already impacting the spatial distribution of many taxa, including bees, plants, birds, butterflies and fishes. A common goal is to detect range shifts in response to climate change, including changes in the centre of the population's distribution (the centre of gravity, COG), population boundaries and area occupied. Conventional estimators, such as the abundance-weighted average (AWA) estimator for COG, confound range shifts with changes in the spatial distribution of available survey data and may be biased when the distribution of survey data shifts over time. AWA also does not estimate the standard error of COG in individual years and cannot incorporate data from multiple survey designs. * To explicitly account for changes in the spatial distribution of survey effort, we propose an alternative species distribution function (SDF) estimator. The SDF approach involves calculating distribution metrics, including COG, population boundary and area occupied, directly from the predicted species distribution or density function. We illustrate the SDF approach using a spatiotemporal model that is available as an r package. Using simulated data, we confirm that the SDF substantially decreases bias in COG estimates relative to the AWA estimator. We then illustrate the method by analysing data from two data sets spanning 1977–2013 for 18 marine fishes along the U.S. West Coast. * In our case study, the SDF estimator shows significant northward shifts for six of 18 species (with southward shifts for only 2), where two species (darkblotched and greenstriped rockfishes) have both a northward shift and a decreased area occupied. Pelagic species (e.g. Pacific hake and spiny dogfish) have more variable distribution than bottom-associated species. We also find substantial differences between AWA and SDF estimates of COG that are likely caused by shifts in sampling distribution (which affect the AWA but not the SDF estimator). * We caution that common estimators for range shift can yield inappropriate inference whenever sampling designs have shifted over time. We conclude by suggesting further improvements in model-based approaches to analysing climate impacts, including methods addressing the impact of local and regional temperature changes on species distribution.},

@article{Dayton1999,
abstract = {This paper integrates long-term descriptive and experimental studies of the effects of ocean climate on inter- and intraspecific competition, as expressed by recruitment, density, survivorship, growth, and reproduction of the most conspicuous kelp species in the Point Loma kelp forest community off San Diego, California, USA. The species included Macrocystis pyrifera, with a floating canopy; Pterygophora californica and Eisenia arborea, which rely on stipes to support their canopy; Laminaria farlowii, with a prostrate canopy; and a speciose red algal turf. To evaluate the roles of large-scale oceanographic processes on biological processes across important depth gradients, the study was carried out over nine years during a cold-water, nutrient-rich La Nifna event (1988-1989) and a warm-water, nutrient-stressed El Nifio period (1992-1994), over a depth range of 8-23 m. This depth range encompassed strong physical gradients involving factors that are critical for kelp growth, including bottom temperatures (correlated with nutrients) and light levels. To examine interactions among these kelps, we established clearings across the depth gradient and then manipulated Macrocystis recruit densities. The demographic responses offer an understanding of the "fundamental" vs. "realized" niches of these species. Eval- uating these patterns, as they are influenced by inter- and intraspecific competition, offers insights into the "realized niches" of the kelps. With the exception of some understory effects on Macrocystis recruitment and some evidence of intraspecific competition during the nutrient-rich La Ninia conditions, we found little influence of competitive effects on Macrocystis. The response of Pterygophora to manipulations and disturbances suggests light-limited recruitment, and competition with Macrocystis was exhibited via reduced growth and reproduction, but not survivorship. No nutrient stress was observed in Ptery- gophora reproduction. Eisenia recruitment is rare, but once established, juveniles had very good survivorship, with growth and reproduction reduced by depth; the Macrocystis treat- ment was more important than depth, suggesting the importance of light to Eisenia re- cruitment and growth. In general, Macrocystis had massive effects on Laminaria growth and reproduction, the strength varying with depth. In particular, there were very strong effects of competition with Macrocystis during the nutrient-rich La Ninia period when Macrocystis had a dense surface canopy. In addition to the Macrocystis effects, there were some significant Pterygophora effects on Laminaria growth during El Nifio. The strongest biological definition of realized niches occurred during the nutrient-rich La Ninia period, especially in shallow depths. One of the most important conclusions of this paper is the appreciation of the importance of scaling in time to include oceanographic climate. There are many seasonal patterns, but the interannual scales that encompass El Nifios and La Nifias, and ultimately the interdecadal-scale oceanographic regime shifts that affect the intensity of canopy competition with Macrocystis, are critical for this system because surface-water nutrients have pervasive long-term effects on the other kelps. Small- scale patterns are driven by local processes (competition, disturbance, dispersal, etc.) that potentially are important at larger scales; however, our most lasting effects result from very large-scale, low-frequency episodic changes in nutrients, with cascading competitive con- sequences to the other algal populations in the community},

abstract = {Successful mitigation of negative effects of global warming will depend on understanding the link between physiological and ecological responses of key species. We show that while metabolic adjustment may assist Australasian kelp beds to persist and maintain abundance in warmer waters, it also reduces the physiological responsiveness of kelps to perturbation, and suppresses canopy recovery from disturbances by reducing the ecological performance of kelp recruits. This provides a warning not to rely solely on inventories of distribution and abundance to evaluate ecosystem function. The erosion of resilience is mediated by a shift in adult-juvenile interactions from competitive under cool to facilitative under warm conditions, supporting the prediction that positive interactions may become increasingly important in a warmer future. Kelp beds may remain intact but with a lower threshold for where additional impacts (e.g., extreme storms or reduced water quality) will lead to persistent loss of habitat and ecological function.},

abstract = {Identifying the type and strength of interactions between local anthropogenic and other stressors can help to set achievable management targets for degraded marine ecosystems and support their resilience by identifying local actions. We undertook a meta-analysis, using data from 118 studies to test the hypothesis that ongoing global declines in the dominant habitat along temperate rocky coastlines, forests of canopy-forming algae and/or their replacement by mat-forming algae are driven by the nonadditive interactions between local anthropogenic stressors that can be addressed through management actions (fishing, heavy metal pollution, nutrient enrichment and high sediment loads) and other stressors (presence of competitors or grazers, removal of canopy algae, limiting or excessive light, low or high salinity, increasing temperature, high wave exposure and high UV or CO2 ), not as easily amenable to management actions. In general, the cumulative effects of local anthropogenic and other stressors had negative effects on the growth and survival of canopy-forming algae. Conversely, the growth or survival of mat-forming algae was either unaffected or significantly enhanced by the same pairs of stressors. Contrary to our predictions, the majority of interactions between stressors were additive. There were however synergistic interactions between nutrient enrichment and heavy metals, the presence of competitors, low light and increasing temperature, leading to amplified negative effects on canopy-forming algae. There were also synergistic interactions between nutrient enrichment and increasing CO2 and temperature leading to amplified positive effects on mat-forming algae. Our review of the current literature shows that management of nutrient levels, rather than fishing, heavy metal pollution or high sediment loads, would provide the greatest opportunity for preventing the shift from canopy to mat-forming algae, particularly in enclosed bays or estuaries because of the higher prevalence of synergistic interactions between nutrient enrichment with other local and global stressors, and as such it should be prioritized.},

abstract = {Forecasting distribution shifts under novel environmental conditions is a major task for ecologists and conservationists. Researchers forecast distribution shifts using several tools including: predicting from an empirical relationship between a summary of distribution (population centroid) and annual time series (“annual regression,” AR); or fitting a habitat‐envelope model to historical distribution and forecasting given predictions of future environmental conditions (“habitat envelope,” HE). However, surprisingly little research has estimated forecast skill by fitting to historical data, forecasting distribution shifts and comparing forecasts with subsequent observations of distribution shifts. I demonstrate the important role of retrospective skill testing by forecasting poleward movement over 1‐, 2‐ or 3‐year periods for 20 fish and crab species in the Eastern Bering Sea and comparing forecasts with observed shifts. I specifically introduce an alternative vector‐autoregressive spatio‐temporal (VAST) forecasting model, which can include species temperature responses, and compare skill for AR, HE and VAST forecasts. Results show that the HE forecast has 30{\%}–43{\%} greater variance than predicting that future distribution is identical to the estimated distribution in the final year (a “persistence” forecast). Meanwhile, the AR explains 2{\%}–6{\%} and VAST explains 8{\%}–25{\%} of variance in poleward movement, and both have better performance than a persistence forecast. HE and AR both generate forecast intervals that are too narrow, while VAST models with or without temperature have appropriate width for forecast intervals. Retrospective skill testing for more regions and taxa should be used as a test bed to guide future improvements in methods for forecasting distribution shifts.},

abstract = {Evidence for the geographic generality of the causes of intertidal zonation and the indirect effects of a ‘keystone' predator, the sea otter, on subtidal kelp assemblages was examined. Most research on intertidal algal assemblages has been done at a few protected sites where zonation is distinct. Surveys of wave-exposed intertidal sites in central and northern California show that assemblage structure is highly variable. This indicates that our present understanding of assemblage organization, including the effects of mussel-algal interactions, may not be widely applicable. Surveys of kelp forest habitat along the entire coast of California suggest that deforestation by sea urchins is uncommon in the absence of sea otters. These examples indicate that the generality of commonly accepted causes of algal assemblage structure in the Northeast Pacific may be an illusion based on assumptions of environmental homogeneity.},

abstract = {Evaluation of the ecosystem effects of fishing presupposes that it is possible to measure the state of an ecosystem, detect differences among measures of its state, and determine if the differences are due to chance or impacts of fishing. Ecologists have developed or adopted four main classes of community/ecosystem metrics for such tasks: diversity and similarity indices, ordination methods, metrics of aggregate community proper- ties, and metrics derived from ecosystem models. Each class is explained briefly, and guidance is given to the literature. Size spectra, k-dominance curves, and multi- dimensional scaling emerge as promising methods for these uses. Some modelling frameworks also may be useful, but more work is needed on sensitivity testing and development of independent theory for these models. The current theoretical basis for most ecosystem models assumes that competition structures the system being mod- elled. Problems with applying that framework to exploited marine systems are reviewed. Resampling methods are essential when testing for differences among community metrics. Practices for determining causality when ecosystem metrics change are reviewed, and additional knowledge and data necessary to link change to cause are highlighted.},

abstract = {World production of sea urchins peaked in 1995, when 120 306 t were landed. Chile dominates world production, producing more than half the world's total landings of 90 257 t in 1998. Other important fisheries are found in Japan, Maine, British Columbia, California, South Korea, New Brunswick, Russia, Mexico, Alaska, Nova Scotia, and in a number of countries that produced less than 1000 t in 1998. Aside from the Chilean fishery for Loxechinus albus, most harvest is of Strongylocentrouts spp., particularly S. intermedius, S. firanciscanus, and S. droebachiensis. Only a small minority of fisheries have been formally assessed and in the absence of such assessments it is difficult to determine whether fisheries are over-fished or whether the large declines observed in many represent the "fish down" of accumulated biomass. Nevertheless, those in Chile, Japan, Maine, California and Washington and a number of smaller fisheries, have declined considerably since their peaks and are likely to be over-fished. Fisheries in Japan, South Korea and the Philippines have been enhanced by reseeding hatchery-reared juveniles and by modifying reefs to increase their structural complexity and to promote the growth of algae. Sea urchin fisheries have potentially large ecological effects, usually mediated through increases in the abundance and biomass of large brown algae. Although such effects may have important consequences for management of these and related fisheries, only in Nova Scotia, South Korea and Japan is ecological knowledge incorporated into management.},

abstract = {Interannual variation in experimental field conditions pro-duce variability in the results of experiments monitored over multiple years, termed here " year effects. " When experimental treatments are replicated in separate years, interannual variation may influence treatment effects and produce significant treatment by initiation-year interac-tions. Understanding the frequency and strength of these effects requires initiating identical experiments across years. We conducted a review of literature covering more than 500 experimental articles published in 7 journals between 1966 and 2008. Only 5{\%} of the 276 general eco-logical field studies initiated experiments in multiple years. This rarity was even more evident in the journal Restora-tion Ecology, in which none of the 173 surveyed experi-mental studies initiated experiments in multiple years. In contrast, 48{\%} of the 58 field experiments published in an agronomy journal were replicated across years. We found only 17 studies that tested treatment by initiation-year interactions. Despite their rarity, 76{\%} of these studies found significant interactions between treatment and initia-tion year. We conclude that the results of many ecological field experiments are likely to be contingent on the year in which they are implemented. We discuss the impor-tance of treatment by initiation-year interactions in ecology and restoration, factors that have hindered the inclusion of temporal replication in the past, and some suggestions for the appropriate design and analysis of temporally repli-cated experiments. We argue for more deliberate investiga-tion of temporal contingency in ecological experimentation, especially in the field of restoration ecology, which may be particularly sensitive to treatment by initiation-year interactions.},

@article{Jensen2012a,
abstract = {There are many examples of ecological theory informing fishery management. Yet fisheries also provide tremendous opportunities to test ecological theory through large-scale, repeated, and well-documented perturbations of natural systems. Although treating fisheries as experiments presents several challenges, few comparable tests exist at the ecosystem scale. Experimental manipulations of fish populations in lakes have been widely used to develop and test ecological theory. Controlled manipulation of fish populations in open marine systems is rarely possible, but fisheries data provide a valuable substitute for such manipulations. To highlight the value of marine fisheries data, we review leading ecological theories that have been empirically tested using such data. For example, density dependence has been examined through meta-analysis of spawning stock and recruitment data to show that compensation (higher population growth) occurs commonly when populations are reduced to low levels, while depensation (the Allee effect) is rare. As populations decline, spatial changes typically involve populations contracting into highdensity core habitats while abandoning less productive habitats. Fishing down predators may result in trophic cascades, possibly shifting entire ecosystems into alternate stable states, although alternate states can be maintained by both ecological processes and continued fishing pressure. Conversely, depleting low trophic level groups may affect central-place foragers, although these bottom–up effects rarely appear to impact fish—perhaps because many fish populations have been reduced to the point that they are no longer prey limited. Fisheries provide empirical tests for diversity–stability relations: catch data suggest that more diverse systems recover faster and provide more stable returns than less diverse systems. Fisheries have also provided examples of the tragedy of the commons, as well as counter-examples where common property resources have been managed successfully. We also address two barriers to use of fisheries data to answer ecological questions: differences in terminology for similar concepts and misuse of records of fishery landings (catch data) as a proxy for biomass trends.},

abstract = {Trophic cascade hypotheses for biological communities, linking predation by upper trophic levels to major features of ecological structure and dynamics at lower trophic levels, are widely subscribed and may influence conservation policy. Few such hypotheses have been evaluated for temporal or spatial generality. Previous studies of sea otter (Enhydra lutris) predation along the outer coast of North America suggest a pattern, often elevated to the status of paradigm, in which sea otter presence leads to reduced sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus spp.) biomass and rapid increases in abundance and diversity of annual algal species, followed by a decline in diversity as one or a few perennial algal species become dominant. Both sea otter predation and commercial sea urchin harvest are ecologically and economically important sources of urchin mortality in nearshore benthic systems in northern Washington marine waters. We recorded changes in density of macroalgae in San Juan Channel, a marine reserve in the physically protected inland waters of northern Washington, resulting from three levels of experimental urchin harvest: (1) simulated sea otter predation (monthly complete harvest of sea urchins), (2) simulated commercial urchin harvest (annual size-selective harvest of sea urchins), and (3) no harvest (control). The two experimental urchin removal treatments did not significantly increase the density of perennial (Agarum and Laminaria) or annual (Desmarestia, Costaria, Alaria and Nereocystis) species of macroalgae after 2 years, despite significant and persistent decreases in urchin densities. Our results suggest that other factors such as grazing by other invertebrates, the presence of dense Agarum stands, and recruitment frequency of macroalgae and macroinvertebrates may play a large role in influencing community structure in San Juan Channel and other physically protected marine waters within the range of sea otters.

abstract = {We put forward a combined observing and modeling strategy for evaluating effects of environmental forcing on the dynamics of spatially structured cod populations spawning in the western Gulf of Maine. Recent work indicates at least two genetically differentiated complexes in this region: a late spring spawning, coastal population centered in Ipswich Bay, and a population that spawns in winter inshore and on nearshore banks in the Gulf of Maine and off southern New England. The two populations likely differ in trophic interactions and in physiological and behavioral responses to different winter and spring environments. Coupled physical-biological modeling has advanced to the point where within-decade forecasting of environmental conditions for recruitment to each of the two populations is feasible. However, the modeling needs to be supported by hydrographic, primary production and zooplankton data collected by buoys, and by data from remote sensing and fixed station sampling. Forecasts of environmentally driven dispersal and growth of planktonic early life stages, combined with an understanding of possible population-specific predator fields, usage of coastal habitat by juveniles and adult resident and migratory patterns, can be used to develop scenarios for spatially explicit population responses to multiple forcings, including climate change, anthropogenic impacts on nearshore juvenile habitat, connectivity among populations and management interventions such as regional fisheries closures. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Dietary diversity often varies inversely with prey resource abundance. This pattern, although typically measured at the population level, is usually assumed to also characterize the behavior of individual animals within the population. However, the pattern might also be produced by changes in the degree of variation among individuals. Here we report on dietary and associated behavioral changes that occurred with the experimental translocation of sea otters from a food-poor to a food-rich environment. Although the diets of all individuals were broadly similar in the food-rich environment, a behaviorally based dietary polymorphism existed in the food-poor environment. Higher dietary diversity under low resource abundance was largely driven by greater variation among individuals. We further show that the dietary polymorphism in the food-poor environment included a broad suite of correlated behavioral variables and that the individuals that comprised specific behavioral clusters benefited from improved foraging efficiency on their individually preferred prey. Our findings add to the growing list of examples of extreme individuality in behavior and prey choice within populations and suggest that this phenomenon can emerge as a behavioral manifestation of increased population density. Individuality in foraging behavior adds complexity to both the fitness consequences of prey selection and food web dynamics, and it may figure prominently as a diversifying process over evolutionary timescales.},

abstract = {1. Longitudinal records of prey selection by 10 adult female sea otters on the Monterey Peninsula, California, from 1983 to 1990 demonstrate extreme inter-individual vari- ation in diet. Variation in prey availability cannot explain these differences as the data were obtained from a common spatial-temporal area. 2. Individual dietary patterns persisted throughout our study, thus indicating that they are life-long characteristics. 3. Individual dietary patterns in sea otters appear to be transmitted along matrilines, probably by way of learning during the period of mother–young association. 4. Efficient utilization of different prey types probably requires radically different sensory/motor skills, each of which is difficult to acquire and all of which may exceed the learning and performance capacities of any single individual. This would explain the absence of generalists and inertia against switching, but not the existence of alternative specialists. 5. Such individual variation might arise in a constant environment from frequency-dependent effects, whereby the relative benefit of a given prey specialization depends on the number of other individuals utilizing that prey. Additionally, many of the sea otter's prey fluctuate substantially in abundance through time. This temporal variation, in conjunction with matrilineal transmission of foraging skills, may act to mediate the temporal dynamics of prey specializations. 6. Regardless of the exact cause, such extreme individual variation in diet has broad ramifications for population and community ecology. 7. The published literature indicates that similar patterns occur in many other species.},

Verifying this diagnosis is important because it implies a radically different view on management options, and on the potential effects of global change on such ecosystems. For instance, it implies that gradual changes in temperature or other factors might have little effect until a threshold is reached at which a large shift occurs that might be difficult to reverse. Strategies to assess whether alternative stable states are present are now converging in fields as disparate as desertification, limnology, oceanography and climatology. Here, we review emerging ways to link theory to observation, and conclude that although, field observations can provide hints of alternative stable states, experiments and models are essential for a good diagnosis.},

abstract = {Catch per unit effort (cpue) data for the South African west coast Cape hakes Merluccius capensis and M. paradoxus were standardized by applying the Generalized Linear Modelling (GLM) technique. The resulting standardized series indicated that resource abundance declined at a rate of 0.4{\%} per annum over the period 1978–1994. Further investigation revealed that the model applied did not adequately adjust for effort being directed away from hake towards other species. This was because, for low bycatch cpue, there was a positive rather than the expected negative correlation with hake catch rates. A method to correct for this inadequate adjustment, taking account of an assumed underlying reason of positively correlated fluctuations in catchability of hake and bycatch species, was developed and tested by simulation. This resulted in a more optimistic view of resource status, indicating a 0.6{\%} per year increase in abundance over the period considered. This result remained contrary to general perceptions in the industry that there was a substantial improvement in resource abundance over the 17-year period considered, as suggested by a 4{\%} increase in abundance per year in nominal cpue. The reasons that the GLM indicated a lesser increase in resource abundance were that the effective average power of the fleet increased, the fleet moved over time to deeper water, where catch rates were higher, and the increase in fish density in deeper water was more than offset by a simultaneous decrease in density in shallower waters. The inadequate bycatch adjustment arose from the analyses inappropriately including bycatch species that co-occur with hake, and hence are taken incidentally in hake-directed fishing, instead of only species whose capture requires a different targeting of effort.},

abstract = {California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) off the coast of Southern California are known to damage both commercial and recreational fishing activities, causing decreases to fish catch and damage to gear. Their increasing population has intensified the potential for conflict between sea lions and anglers, likely requiring changes to current legislation. The recreational fishing community in Southern California is a valuable and largely underutilized source for information and potential solutions to management and legislative problems. This recreational fishing survey-based study conducted in 2013 utilized personal interviews, conducted in the field with recreational anglers and commercial passenger fishing vessel (CPFV) crews in Southern California, to gather data on: (a) the occurrence and impact of sea lion depredation on the local fishing, (b) angler awareness and opinions on current legislation, and (c) the conflict between fishing activities and conservation efforts. Results show that surveyed CPFV operators and private boaters had the most conflict with sea lions and perceive them as more of a problem than anglers on piers, jetties or kayaks. The conflict was also reportedly more prevalent in San Diego County compared to the other counties surveyed (Orange, Los Angeles and Ventura). Participating CPFV operators were overwhelmingly in support of a government culling program for sea lions, while recreational angler respondents did not feel that a control program was necessary. These CPFV operators reported more money lost, and were willing to pay more for an effective deterrent device. There was also a consensus among respondents that fish catch is declining, yet anglers were unsatisfied with the effectiveness of current legislation designed to increase fish stocks. These data will provide a better understanding of California sea lion depredation in Southern California and its effect on recreational anglers in order to aid future mitigation efforts. Additionally, these results provide stakeholder feedback on local marine protected areas and other fisheries management legislation, and build a foundation for future conservation and education programs.},

abstract = {The 1991 Benguela Ecology Programme Workshop on Seal-Fishery Biological Interactions outlined an approach to examine the qualitative effects of culls of a seal population on catches and catch rates of commer-cial fisheries. This paper applies that approach to examine the effects of possible culls of Cape fur seals Arcro-cephalu.l" pusiJ/us pusiJ/us on catches and catch rates of the bottom-trawl fishery for the Cape hakes off the South African west coast. The approach involves constructing a "minimal realistic model" of the hake-seal sys-tem. The model considered here includes the two species of Cape hake, Merlllccius capensis and M. paradoxus, the Cape fur seal and an "other predatory fish" component. Values for parameters of the model are derived from biological studies and by fitting to abundance indices for the hake and seal populations. The model is able to mimic the catch rate information for hake satisfactorily for a range of scenarios for the carrying capacity of the seal population, although the trend in hake abundance indicated since seal harvests commenced some four centuries ago until the start of the hake fishery in 1917 is, of course, questionable. The impact of the seal culls examined on the hake fishery is minimal (and can even be detrimental) for the base-case model, which takes ac-count of both hake species and assumes that seals do nol prey on the deep-water hake species M. paradoxlls. This result is insensitive to changes to the values of most of those parameters of the model that are not well known. However, increasing the extent of predation by seals on M. paradoxus leads to greater projected bene-fits for the hake fishery under a future seal cull. It seems likely that a change in the future pattern of fishing to renect a greater relative fishing intensity upon M. mpensis would have a similar result. The conclusions of the paper will not necessarily apply to Olher southern African regions where the M. paradoxus : M. mpells;s is much lower than on the South African west coast.

abstract = {T: El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) remains the mos ˜ t important coupled ocean–atmosphere phenomenon to cause global climate variability on seasonal to interannual time scales. This paper addresses the need for a reliable ENSO index that allows for the historical deﬁnition of ENSO events in the instrumental record back to 1871. The Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) was originally deﬁned as the ﬁrst seasonally varying principal component of six atmosphere–ocean (COADS) variable ﬁelds in the tropical Paciﬁc basin. It provides for a more complete and ﬂexible description of the ENSO phenomenon than single variable ENSO indices such as the SOI or Nino 3.4 SST. Here we describe our effort to boil ˜ the MEI concept down to its most essential components (based on SLP, SST) to enable historical analyses that more than double its period of record to 1871–2005. The new MEI.ext conﬁrms that ENSO activity went through a lull in the earlyto mid-20th century, but was just about as prevalent one century ago as in recent decades. We diagnose strong relationships between peak amplitudes of ENSO events and their duration, as well as between their peak amplitudes and their spacing (periodicity). Our effort is designed to help with the assessment of ENSO conditions through as long a record as possible to be able to differentiate between ‘natural' ENSO behaviour in all its rich facets, and the ‘Brave New World' of this phenomenon under evolving GHG-related climate conditions. So far, none of the behaviour of recent ENSO events appears unprecedented, including duration, onset timing, and spacing in the last few decades compared to a full century before then.},

abstract = {Insight into potential mechanisms of succession following disturbance to an ecological community can be gained by considering processes that contribute to the rise (colonization, interactions with established species) and demise (differential mortality) of specific stages within the successional sequence. Most successional theories focus on the rise to dominance, assuming demise is the result of competition, but other factors can cause differential mortality among species, including physi- cal disturbance, senescence, and consumers. In rocky intertidal communities on the coast of Washington state, USA, gaps in mussel beds exhibit a succession from predator-susceptible to predator-resistant species following disturbance, suggesting that differential consumption by mobile species may play an important role in the demise of early succession species and the eventual domi- nance of the mussel Mytilus californianus. Experimental manipulation of a dominant species earlier in succession, the blue mussel Mytilus trossulus, demonstrated that this species inhibits the invasion of M. californianus in the absence of predators. Experimental manipulation of predatory snails (Nucella emarginata and Nucella canaliculata), which feed heavily on M. trossulus but not M. californi- anus, greatly increased the rate at which M. californianus invaded gaps. These results and those of other studies indicate that consumers frequently have important effects on the dynamics of succes- sion in benthic marine systems, and might also play a role in other settings.},

During that time, the practice of rescuing, treating, and releasing live-stranded sea otters has evolved into a sophisticated research and conservation endeavor. Unlike early efforts that sought to keep stranded sea otters alive and place them into permanent zoo or aquarium homes, recent trends have focused on conducting research with live-stranded otters, contributing to a broad range of sea otter conservation projects, and releasing healthy, capable sea otters into the wild population. New techniques for rearing live-stranded sea otter pups using non-releasable adult females as surrogate mothers have shown significant promise and have helped the program identify new ways to support sea otter conservation efforts. Operating a live-stranding program has allowed program personnel to continue advancing sea otter care and husbandry techniques. This chapter addresses the context for determining the value of rescuing, treating, and releasing sea otters, and offers guidance to other wildlife care and rehabilitation programs that aspire toward responsible, meaningful wildlife-care practices.},

abstract = {No-take marine reserves directly promote the recovery of predatory species, which can have negative indirect effects on prey populations in reserves. When harvesting also occurs on prey species there is potential conflict between the direct and indirect effects of protection, and reserves may not have conservation benefits for prey species. For example, sea urchins are fished in many regions, but may decline in reserves due to increased predation rates. To investigate this potential conflict, this paper compares density, size, biomass and reproductive potential of both a harvested and an unharvested urchin species between a long-term reserve and unprotected sites in California. Consistent with density-mediated indirect interactions, densities of the unharvested species were 3.4-times higher at unprotected sites compared to reserve sites. However, for the harvested species, densities were comparable between reserve and unprotected sites. Both species were consistently larger at reserve sites, and the biomass and reproductive potential of the harvested species was 4.8- and 7.0-times higher, respectively, than at unprotected sites. This is likely due to differences in size-selectivity between harvesting and predators, and potential compensatory effects of predators. While the generality of these effects needs to be tested, these results suggest mechanisms whereby reserves can benefit both predator and prey species.},

abstract = {Fluctuations in abundance of commercially valuable crustacean stocks in sub-Arctic ecosystems have been variously attributed to the effects of climatic forcing, fishing pressure, and predation, mostly by gadoid fishes. Landings of snow crab, Chionoecetes opilio (J. C. Fabricius, 1788), from the eastern Bering Sea declined after the early 1990s, reaching historical lows a decade later. At the same time, two phenomena became apparent in the dynamics of the primiparae (first-time female breeders): their geographic range contracted to the northwest along the middle shelf (50–100 m depth), and the contraction was punctuated by periodic recruitment to the mature female pool, with a period of approximately 7 yrs and declining amplitude. The first phenomenon has been addressed by the environmental ratchet hypothesis, which attributes the contraction to a combination of an ontogenetic female migration, circulation patterns, the spatial dynamics of benthic stages in relation to near-bottom temperature, and predation by Pacific cod, Gadus macrocephalus Tilesius, 1810. Mortality due to cod predation in the Middle Domain, apparently related to near-bottom temperature, increased after 1995, contributing to the ratchet effect and the disappearance of periodic pulses of primipara abundance. Cod predation does not, however, appear to have controlled the frequency of periodic recruitment fluctuations. On the other hand, amplitude of fluctuations of primipara abundance in the Middle Domain, purportedly the "engine" of renewal of this stock, do appear to be affected by both predation and climate, whose interaction is complex but perhaps interpretable.},

abstract = {Over the past 20 years, major advances have clarified how ecological patterns inform theory, and how in turn theory informs applied ecology. Also, there has been an increased recognition that the problem of scale at which ecological processes should be considered is critical if we are to produce general predictions. Ecological dynamics is always stochastic at small scales, but variability is conditional on the scale of description. The radical changes in the scope and aims of ecology over the past decades reflect in part the need to address pressing societal issues of environmental change. Technological advances in molecular biology, global positioning, sensing instrumentation and computational power should not be overlooked as an explanation for these radical changes. However, I argue that conceptual unification across ecology, genetics, evolution and physiology has fostered even more fertile questions. We are moving away from the view that evolution is played in a fixed ecological theatre: the theatre is being rapidly and relentlessly redesigned by the players themselves. The maintenance of ecosystem functions depends on shifts in species assemblages and on cellular metabolism, not only on flows of energy and matter. These findings have far reaching implications for our understanding of how ecosystem function and biodiversity will withstand (or not) environmental changes in the 21st century.},

abstract = {Detecting and forecasting the effects of changing climate on natural and exploited populations represent a major challenge to ecologists and resource managers. These efforts are complicated by underlying density-dependent processes and the differ-ential responses of predators and their prey to changing climate. We explored the effects of density-dependence and changing climate on growth of juvenile sockeye salmon and the densities of their zooplankton prey in the Wood River system of southwestern Alaska. We fit dynamic time-series models to data collected between 1962 and 2002 describing growth of juvenile sockeye, timing of spring ice breakup, and summer zooplankton densities. The timing of spring breakup has moved about seven days earlier now than it was in the early 1960s. Our analyses suggest that most of this shift has been a response to the warm phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation that persisted from the mid-1970s to the late 1990s. This progression toward earlier spring breakup dates was associated with warmer summer water temperatures and increased zooplankton (especially Daphnia) densities, which translated into increased sockeye growth during their first year of life. The number of spawning adults that produced each year class of sockeye had a strong negative effect on juvenile sockeye growth rates, so that the size of the density-dependent effect was, on average, twice as large as the effect of spring breakup date. These results highlight the complexity of eco-logical responses to changing climate and suggest that climate warming may enhance growing conditions for juvenile salmonids in large lakes of Alaska.},

At its inception, fishery science was limited by a nineteenth century mechanistic worldview and by computational technology; thus, the relatively simple equations of population ecology became the fundamental ecological science underlying fisheries. The time has come for this to change and for community ecology to become the fundamental ecological science underlying fisheries. This point will be illustrated with two examples. First, when viewed from a community perspective, excess production must be considered in the context of biomass left for predators. We argue that this is a better measure of the effects of fisheries than spawning biomass per recruit. Second, we shall analyse a simple, but still multi-species, model for fishery management that considers the alternatives of harvest regulations, inshore marine protected areas and offshore marine protected areas. Population or community perspectives lead to very different predictions about the efficacy of reserves.},

These algae are commonly referred to as kelps, although the term technically refers to Laminariales only. Their high productivity and complicated biological structure make kelps especially important members of their communities. For this reason, these communities have received a great deal of research, including one of the first scientific applications of diving (128). This review summarizes the status of research programs operating within very different scales and emphasizes the point that a real understanding of the processes under study must come from the proper perspective and integration of the other levels.},

abstract = {Habitat loss, overexploitation, and numerous other stressors have caused global declines in apex predators. This “trophic downgrading” has generated widespread concern because of the fundamental role that apex predators can play in ecosystem functioning, disease regulation, and biodiversity maintenance. In attempts to combat declines, managers have conducted reintroductions, imposed stricter harvest regulations, and implemented protected areas. We suggest that full recovery of viable apex predator populations is currently the exception rather than the rule. We argue that, in addition to well-known considerations, such as continued exploitation and slow life histories, there are several underappreciated factors that complicate predator recoveries. These factors include three challenges. First, a priori identification of the suite of trophic interactions, such as resource limitation and competition that will influence recovery can be difficult. Second, defining and accomplishing predator recovery in the context of a dynamic ecosystem requires an appreciation of the timing of recovery, which can determine the relative density of apex predators and other predators and therefore affect competitive outcomes. Third, successful recovery programs require designing adaptive sequences of management strategies that embrace key environmental and species interactions as they emerge. Consideration of recent research on food web modules, alternative stable states, and community assembly offer important insights for predator recovery efforts and restoration ecology more generally. Foremost among these is the importance of a social-ecological perspective in facilitating a long-lasting predator restoration while avoiding unintended consequences.},

Assessing reserve performance in an adaptive management framework ideally involves predicting the response of populations and communities to reserves (typically in the design process) and testing predicted outcomes against observations. Here we compare existing modeling and empirical studies on no-take marine reserves, and provide a prospectus for their future integration. Numerical models of ecological responses to reserves typically project long-term, steady-state interactions over the relatively broad spatial scales of larval dispersal, reserve configuration, fishing effort, and fish movement. Existing empirical studies focus on short-term outcomes over small scales, typically aggregated over many explanatory factors.

abstract = {Natural systems are often complex and dynamic (i.e. nonlinear), making them difficult to understand using linear statistical approaches. Linear approaches are fundamentally based on correlation. Thus, they are ill-posed for dynamical systems, where correlation can occur without causation, and causation may also occur in the absence of correlation. “Mirage correlation” (i.e., the sign and magnitude of the correlation change with time) is a hallmark of nonlinear systems that results from state dependency. State dependency means that the relationships among interacting variables change with different states of the system. In recent decades, nonlinear methods that acknowledge state dependence have been developed. These nonlinear statistical methods are rooted in state space reconstruction, i.e. lagged coordinate embedding of time series data. These methods do not assume any set of equations governing the system but recover the dynamics from time series data, thus called empirical dynamic modeling (EDM). EDM bears a variety of utilities to investigating dynamical systems. Here, we provide a step-by-step tutorial for EDM applications with rEDM, a free software package written in the R language. Using model examples, we aim to guide users through several basic applications of EDM, including (1) determining the complexity (dimensionality) of a system, (2) distinguishing nonlinear dynamical systems from linear stochastic systems, and quantifying the nonlinearity (i.e. state dependence), (3) determining causal variables, (4) forecasting, (5) tracking the strength and sign of interaction, and (6) exploring the scenario of external perturbation. These methods and applications can be used to provide a mechanistic understanding of dynamical systems.},

Human influences on marine ecosystems mediate changes in species interactions. This generality is evinced by the cascading effects of overharvesting top predators on the structure and function of marine ecosystems. It follows that ecological forecasting, ecosystem management, and marine spatial planning require a better understanding of food web relationships. Characterising and scaling predator-prey interactions for use in tactical and strategic tools (i.e. multi-species management and ecosystem models) are paramount in this effort. Here, we explore what issues are involved and must be considered to advance the use of predator-prey theory in the context of marine fisheries science. We address pertinent contemporary ecological issues including (1) the approaches and complexities of evaluating predator responses in marine systems; (2) the 'scaling up' of predator-prey interactions to the population, community, and ecosystem level; (3) the role of predator-prey theory in contemporary fisheries and ecosystem modelling approaches; and (4) directions for the future.

abstract = {Sea otters are well known as a keystone species because of their ability to transform sea urchin-dominated communities into kelp-dominated communities by preying on sea urchins and thus reducing the intensity of herbivory. After being locally extinct for more than a century, sea otters re-colonized the Semichi Islands in the Aleutian Archipelago, Alaska in the early 1990s. Here, otter populations increased to about 400 individuals by 1994, but rapidly declined to about 100 by 1997. Roughly 7 yr after initial otter re-colonization, there were only marginal changes in sea urchin biomass, mean maximum test size, and kelp density. These small changes may be the first steps in the cascading effects on community structure typically found with the invasion of a keystone species. However, no wholesale change in community structure occurred following re-colonization and growth of the sea otter population. Instead, this study describes a transition state and identifies factors such as keystone species density and residence time that can be important in dictating the degree to which otter effects are manifested.},

Equilibrium densities wete determined using the number of sea otters observed during spring surveys in 1994, 1995, and 1996 in each of three habitat types where sea otters currently exist. Potential sea otter habitat was defined as from the California coastline to the 40-m isobath and classified as rocky, sandy, or mixed habitat according to the amount of kelp and rocky substrate in the area. The amount of habitat available to sea otters in California was estimated using a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) program. The estimated mean number of sea otters that could be supported by the marine environment to a depth of 40 m in California was 15,941 (95{\%} C1 13,538-18,577). The GIS-based approach incorporated detailed bathymetric contours, produced repeatable and accurate estimates, and served as an innovative method of measuring sea otter habitat. We believe the approach described in this paper represents the best available information on how a sea otter population at equilibrium would be distributed along the California coast.},

abstract = { Certain environmental conditions facilitate the control of primary producers by her-bivores. Environmental change can, therefore, mediate the strength of consumption relative to production such that the abundance of primary producers is altered, potentially driving phase-shifts from one habitat type to another (e.g. the displacement kelp forests by mats of turfs along temperate coasts). Here, we assessed the extent to which herbivores may counter the increased cover of kelp-competitors (i.e. turfs) anticipated to be caused by enriched nutrients and CO2 . Specifically, we experimentally enriched nutrients and CO2 and quantified the change in cover of algal turfs in the presence and absence of gastropod grazers. In the absence of grazers, turf algae responded positively to the combination of enriched nutrients and CO2 such that they occupied {\textgreater} 95{\%} of available space. In contrast, where grazers were present, sparse covers of algal turfs were maintained even under CO2 and nutrient enrichment (i.e. turfs occupied {\textless} 5{\%} of available space). This result indicates that consumption by grazers increased where enrichment of nutrients and CO2 facilitated greater algal cover such that cover continued to be largely restricted. By recognising the environmental conditions which will maintain or disrupt the balance between the processes of production and consumption, we may improve forecasts regarding the probability of habitat stasis or shifts.},

abstract = {Kelp forests are phyletically diverse, structurally complex and highly productive components of cold- water rocky marine coastlines. This paper reviews the conditions in which kelp forests develop globally and where, why and at what rate they become deforested. The ecology and long archaeological history of kelp forests are examined through case studies from southern California, the Aleutian Islands and the western North Atlantic, well-studied locations that represent the widest possible range in kelp forest biodi- versity. Global distribution of kelp forests is physiologically constrained by light at high latitudes and by nutrients, warm temperatures and other macrophytes at low latitudes. Within mid-latitude belts (roughly 40–60° latitude in both hemispheres) well-developed kelp forests are most threatened by herbivory, usually from sea urchins. Overfishing and extirpation of highly valued vertebrate apex predators often triggered herbivore population increases, leading to widespread kelp deforestation. Such deforestations have the most profound and lasting impacts on species-depauperate systems, such as those in Alaska and the western North Atlantic. Globally urchin-induced deforestation has been increasing over the past 2–3 decades. Continued fishing down of coastal food webs has resulted in shifting harvesting targets from apex predators to their invertebrate prey, including kelp-grazing herbivores. The recent global expansion of sea urchin harvesting has led to the wide- spread extirpation of this herbivore, and kelp forests have returned in some locations but, for the first time, these forests are devoid of vertebrate apex predators. In the western North Atlantic, large predatory crabs have recently filled this void and they have become the new apex predator in this system. Similar shifts from fish-to crab-dominance may have occurred in coastal zones of the United Kingdom and Japan, where large predatory finfish were extirpated long ago. Three North American case studies of kelp forests were examined to determine their long history with humans and project the status of future kelp forests to the year 2025. Fishing impacts on kelp forest systems have been both profound and much longer in duration than previously thought. Archaeological data suggest that coastal peoples exploited kelp forest organisms for thousands of years, occasionally resulting in localized losses of apex predators, outbreaks of sea urchin popu- lations and probably small-scale deforestation. Over the past two centuries, commercial exploitation for export led to the extirpation of sea urchin predators, such as the sea otter in the North Pacific and predatory fishes like the cod in the North Atlantic. The large- scale removal of predators for export markets increased sea urchin abundances and promoted the decline of kelp forests over vast areas. Despite southern California having one of the longest known associations with coastal kelp forests, widespread deforestation is rare. It is possible that functional redundancies among predators and herbivores make this most diverse system most stable. Such biodiverse kelp forests may also resist invasion from non-native species. In the species-depauperate western North Atlantic, introduced algal competitors carpet the benthos and threaten future kelp dominance. There, other non-native herbivores and predators have become established and dominant components of this system. Climate changes have had measurable impacts on kelp forest ecosystems and efforts to control the emission of greenhouse gasses should be a global priority. However, overfishing appears to be the greatest manageable threat to kelp forest ecosystems over the 2025 time horizon. Management should focus on minimizing fishing impacts and restoring populations of functionally important species in these systems.},

abstract = {Replicated ecological studies in marine reserves and associated unprotected areas are valuable in examining top-down impacts on communities and the ecosystem-level effects of fishing. We carried out experimental in two temperate marine reserves to examine these top-down influences on shallow subtidal reef communities in northeastern New Zealand. Both reserves examined are known to support high densities of predators and tethering experiments showed that the chance of predation on the dominant sea urchin, Evechinus chloroticus, within both reserves was approximately 7 times higher relative to outside. Predation was most intense on the smallest size class (30-40 mm) of tethered urchins, the size at which urchins cease to exhibit cryptic behaviour. A high proportion of predation on large urchins could be attributed to the spiny lobster, Jasus edwardsii. Predation on the smaller classes was probably by both lobsters and predatory fish, predominantly the sparid Pagrus auratus. The density of adult Evechinus actively razing the substratum in the urchin barrens habitat was found to be significantly lower at marine reserve sites (2.2+/-0.3 m(-2)) relative to non-reserve sites (5.5+/-0.4 m(-2)). There was no difference in the density of cryptic juveniles between reserve and non-reserve sites. Reserve populations were more bimodal, with urchins between 40 and 55 mm occurring at very low numbers. Experimental removal of Evechinus from the urchin barrens habitat over 12 months lead to a change from a crustose coralline algal habitat to a macroalgal dominated habitat. Such macroalgal habitats were found to be more extensive in both reserves, where urchin densities were lower, relative to the adjacent unprotected areas that were dominated by urchin barrens. The patterns observed provide evidence for a top-down role of predators in structuring shallow reef communities in northeastern New Zealand and demonstrate how marine reserves can reverse the indirect effects of fishing and re-establish community-level trophic cascades.},

abstract = {As the smallest and one of the most recently evolved marine mammals, sea otters face physiological challenges rarely encountered by larger, more derived aquatic species. To examine the effect of these challenges on foraging costs and resultant daily energy budgets, we measured the energetics of resting, grooming, diving and foraging for adult, male sea otters. The energy expended for these different behaviors as determined from open flow respirometry was then standardized across activity budgets measured for wild sea otters to estimate field metabolic rates (FMR). We found that the metabolic rate of captive otters performing single dives ranging in duration from 40 to 192 s was 17.6+/-0.5 ml O(2) kg(-1) min(-1) and only 1.3 times resting rates. This rate increased significantly if the animals foraged during submergence. The cost of a foraging dive for sea otters was nearly twice that predicted for phocid seals, which was attributed in part to elevated locomotor costs associated with buoyancy and swimming style. Our behavioral studies indicate that wild sea otters spend the greatest proportion of the day feeding and resting, with the largest daily energy expenditure (6.1+/-1.1 MJ day(-1)) associated with foraging. The resulting mean FMR for wild sea otters based on the energy expended for all behaviors was 15.7+/-2.7 MJ day(-1) and matched predicted FMR values based upon a regression of known FMR values for other marine mammals across a range of body sizes. This was achieved by counterbalancing elevated foraging costs with prolonged periods of rest on the water surface.},

We assembled a global data set for 2260 communities of large mammals, invertebrates, plants, and plankton. We find that predator and prey biomass follow a general scaling law with exponents consistently near ¾. This pervasive pattern implies that the structure of the biomass pyramid becomes increasingly bottom-heavy at higher biomass. Similar exponents are obtained for community production-biomass relations, suggesting conserved links between ecosystem structure and function. These exponents are similar to many body mass allometries, and yet ecosystem scaling emerges independently from individual-level scaling, which is not fully understood. These patterns suggest a greater degree of ecosystem-level organization than previously recognized and a more predictive approach to ecological theory.},

abstract = {Abstract Recent species recoveries following historical depletion have been widely celebrated as conservation success stories. However, the recovery of highly interactive species, particularly predators, generates new management challenges that arise from their potential for wide-ranging effects on local ecosystems and their poorly understood ecology. In marine systems, many pinniped species share parallel histories of depletion, recovery, and human conflict. Recovering from post-exploitation populations of small size, these pinnipeds have returned to their present abundance from a largely absent, or severely reduced, recent role in many coastal ecosystems. To address the challenges arising today from real or perceived overabundance of protected pinniped species, we evaluate the prehistorical, historical, and contemporary abundances of six pinniped species that breed in the contiguous United States. This review highlights gaps in current knowledge that limit the implementation of ecologically grounded approaches to adaptive management of protected species in a time of shifting, or lifting, baselines. To address these gaps will require a diverse cadre of natural and social scientists as well as stakeholders to tackle the questions of how we define recovery at a species or ecosystem level, and when we have reached this point, how we move forward in a way that does not repeat a history of depletion, conservation, and recovery. Doing so will require an understanding of what role highly interactive species play in their ecosystems and how this role shifts with changes in ecological context, as well as the sociological and economic impacts of species restoration to humans. This knowledge is integral to the ongoing transition from a focus on preventing species extinction to new, and often unanticipated, challenges arising from the functional implications of species recovery.},

abstract = {Ecosystem rather than species management has become an explicit part of policies that feature in international treaties and national legislation. Many of the tools that will be needed to fulfil the requirements of these policies are still in an early stage of development. One such tool is trophic ecosystem modelling. These models have been put forward to aid system-level understanding and provide insight into the potential impacts of human activities. Despite this, there are many gaps in knowledge of their strengths and weaknesses. In particular, little is known about the effect of the level of detail in a model on its performance. There has been some consideration of the effects of model formulation, as well as the effects of the physical, biological and chemical scope of multispecies and ecosystem models on their performance. A review of existing research indicates that there is a humped relationship between model detail and performance for these models, and that there are some guiding principles to consider during model development. This review gives some insight into which model structures and assumptions are likely to aid understanding and management, and which may be unnecessary. Further, it provides some understanding of whether some models can capture properties of real systems that other models cannot. The main recommendation is that the use of a single {\OE}ultimate¹ ecosystem model is ill-advised, while the comparative and confirmatory use of multiple {\OE}minimum-realistic¹ models is strongly recommended.},

abstract = {Long-term ecological data sets present opportunities for identifying drivers of community dynamics and quantifying their effects through time series analysis. Multivariate autoregressive (MAR) models are well known in many other disciplines, such as econometrics, but widespread adoption of MAR methods in ecology and natural resource management has been much slower despite some widely cited ecological examples. Here we review previous ecological applications of MAR models and highlight their ability to identify abiotic and biotic drivers of population dynamics, as well as community-level stability metrics, from long- term empirical observations. Thus far, MAR models have been used mainly with data from freshwater plankton communities; we examine the obstacles that may be hindering adoption in other systems and suggest practical modifications that will improve MAR models for broader application. Many of these modifications are already well known in other fields in whichMAR models are common, although they are frequently described under different names. In an effort to make MAR models more accessible to ecologists, we include a worked example using recently developed R packages (MAR1 and MARSS), freely available and open-access software.},

abstract = {We examined evidence for nonlinear dynamics in fishery-independent survey data for an assemblage of 26 fish species on Georges Bank spanning the period 1963 to 2008. We used nonlinear time series analysis to determine (1) the presence of nonlinear dynamics in fish populations on Georges Bank, (2) the minimum number of dimensions required to effectively describe system dynamics, (3) the strength of patterns of co-predictability among all possible pairs of fish species, and (4) identification of groups of species characterized by similar dynamics. Here, nonlinear behavior refers to non-equilibrium dynamics, including chaos. The population trajectories of all 26 species exhibited strong density-dependent feedback as indicated by a Partial Rate Correlation Function analysis. Significant evidence of complex dynamical behavior was found for approximately 1 in 5 species. Low dimensionality for many of the individual series was identified, suggesting that for a given level of predictability, this system can be represented by a relatively small number of critically important ecological variables. Further, we found high levels of copredictability among pairwise combinations of individual species. We identified 4 major species groups sharing similar dynamic features on the basis of patterns of co-predictability, and explored potential mechanisms for interpreting the groupings in terms of trophic interactions and life history characteristics.},

abstract = {Localized ecological interactions can generate striking large-scale spatial patterns in ecosystems through spatial self-organization. Possible mechanisms include oscillating consumer-resource interactions, localized disturbance-recovery processes and scale-dependent feedback. Despite abundant theoretical literature, studies revealing spatial self-organization in real ecosystems are limited. Recently, however, many examples of regular pattern formation have been discovered, supporting the importance of scale-dependent feedback. Here, we review these studies, showing regular pattern formation to be a general phenomenon rather than a peculiarity. We provide a conceptual framework explaining how scale-dependent feedback determines regular pattern formation in ecosystems. More empirical studies are needed to better understand regular pattern formation in ecosystems, and how this affects the response of ecosystems to global environmental change. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A pronounced, widespread and persistent regime shift among marine ecosystems is observable on temperate rocky reefs as a result of sea urchin overgrazing. Here, we empirically define regime-shift dynamics for this grazing system which transitions between productive macroalgal beds and impoverished urchin barrens. Catastrophic in nature, urchin overgrazing in a well-studied Australian system demonstrates a discontinuous regime shift, which is of particular management concern as recovery of desirable macroalgal beds requires reducing grazers to well below the initial threshold of overgrazing. Generality of this regime-shift dynamic is explored across 13 rocky reef systems (spanning 11 different regions from both hemispheres) by compiling available survey data (totalling 10 901 quadrats surveyed in situ) plus experimental regime-shift responses (observed during a total of 57 in situ manipulations). The emergent and globally coherent pattern shows urchin grazing to cause a discontinuous ‘catastrophic' regime shift, with hysteresis effect of approximately one order of magnitude in urchin biomass between critical thresholds of overgrazing and recovery. Different life-history traits appear to create asymmetry in the pace of overgrazing versus recovery. Once shifted, strong feedback mechanisms provide resilience for each alternative state thus defining the catastrophic nature of this regime shift. Importantly, human-derived stressors can act to erode resilience of desirable macroalgal beds while strengthening resilience of urchin barrens, thus exacerbating the risk, spatial extent and irreversibility of an unwanted regime shift for marine ecosystems. },

@article{Bernstein1979a,
abstract = {The community of epiphytes on the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, is simple, con- sisting primarily of the bryozoans Membranipora membranacea, Hippothoa hyalina, and Lichenop- ora buskiana; the serpulid polychaete Spirorbis spirillum; and the hydroids Obelia sp. and Campan- u/aria sp. Abundances of these organisms vary rapidly, by an order of magnitude or more in 2 wk. In spite of this short-term unpredictability, broad patterns of distribution are predictable. Membran- ipora, the competitive dominant, is abundant during winter and spring and absent during summer and fall when surface waters are warm and thermally stratified. When present, it occurs primarily in the canopy along the outer edge of the large (1 x 11 km) Point Loma, San Diego, kelp bed. The distri- bution of the subordinate epiphytes complements that of Membranipora. They occur in the interior portions of the bed, and on the lower, older blades of Macrocystis plants. These patterns are maintained by a sophisticated suite of larval behaviors and settlement prefer- ences. The subordinate epiphytes settle preferentially on the older blades of Macrocystis, and avoid blades from plants on the outer edge of the bed where competitive overgrowth by Membranipora is more likely. In addition the extremely short larval life-spans of the subordinate epiphytes (a few hours) mean that offspring will settle near where they were released, in the interior of the bed. Membranipora, in contrast, has a planktonic lifetime of 2 to 4 wk. Nearshore current measurements indicate that as a result its larvae are flushed from the bed, and that the source of larvae ready to metamorphose and settle must be external to the bed, from other kelp beds in the area. This helps restrict Membranipora to the outer edge of the bed, since larvae are removed from the water as it passes through the bed both by settlement on Macrocystis blades and by plankivorous fish that feed on them. The labrid fish Oxyjulis californica is an important predator in this system. It is a curious, actively searching generalist that excludes large, erect epiphytes such as the barnacle Lepas pacifica and the bivalve Leptopecten latiauritus from the nearshore kelp bed. Field and laboratory experiments imply that Oxyjulis forms short-term search images and switches among prey species. One of the species it regulates is the herbivorous isopod Pentidothea resecta, which, when released from regulation, multiplies rapidly and destroys the kelp canopy. Oxyjulis, though it buffers the system from extinction due to Pentidothea, is also potentially destructive. Small kelp beds, too small for the filtering action to take effect, become heavily encrusted with Membranipora and can be destroyed by Oxyjulis predation on the encrusted blades. The set of relationships among species in this community can fruitfully be viewed as having coevolved to contribute to persistence in this unstable environment. Indeed, some factors that con- tribute to instability are the very ones necessary for persistence. Competition, predation, habitat selection, and life history strategies interact to ensure that the number of species in the community and their interrelationships remain constant. There appear to be no mechanisms acting to regulate epiphyte species to equilibrium levels of abundance. This system is thus best described as one that fluctuates unpredictably within well-defined boundaries},

abstract = {Highly valued, hunted, managed, and traded by indigenous people for at least 12,000 years, sea otters share a deep history of interactions with humans along North America's northwest coast. Yet the nineteenth century extirpation and subsequent recovery of sea otters triggered profound ecological, cultural, and socio-economic transformations that continue to elicit complex trade-offs that coastal communities grapple with today. To expand our understanding of past baselines, future recovery targets, and the role First Nations in British Columbia and Alaska once played in altering and managing coastal resources, including sea otters, we synthesized evidence from archeological faunal remains, historical records, traditional knowledge, and contemporary ecological research. Archeological evidence suggests that sea otter hunting was a significant and widespread practice among aboriginal people in this area throughout the Holocene, although the magnitude of use varied spatially. Furthermore, isotopic evidence suggests that over the millennia, sea otters may have been reduced in numbers, existing below carrying capacity, and excluded near human settlements. Furthermore, traditional knowledge and historical records reveal that indigenous peoples of the northwest coast developed diverse technologies to conserve and manage coastal marine resources, such as selective harvesting, seasonal restrictions on use or consumption, and proprietorship that was contingent on sustained productivity. Ancient marine tenure systems and governance protocols based on reciprocity were used to conserve and spatially manage most marine species, including sea otters. Current First Nations perspectives on sea otter conservation and management vary among people and through time as sea otter population status changes, as communities adapt to this perturbation, and as new legal frameworks supporting First Nations rights to co-management emerge.},

abstract = {The early responses of the field layer to changes in biotic and abiotic conditions are key determinants of the future composition and structure of forests where sustained heavy browsing pressure has depauperated the shrub understory. We investigated the relationships between white-tailed deer density and field layer plant community dynamics in boreal forests managed for wildlife and timber production. We hypothesized that the growth and reproduction of field layer plants are either: (H(1)) directly proportional to deer density, or (H(2)) related to deer density through nonlinear relationships or (H(3)) through nonlinear relationships with thresholds. We tested these hypotheses using data from a controlled browsing experiment involving a gradient of deer densities (0, 7.5, 15, 27 and 56 deer km(-2)) in interaction with timber harvesting conducted on Anticosti Island, Canada. In recent clearcuts, the dominant responses of the field layer plants were exponential recovery in growth and reproduction with decreasing deer densities. The abundance of browse-tolerant species such as grasses was positively related to deer density, suggesting an apparent competitive gain. These results support the prediction from our second hypothesis, although the presence of ecological thresholds should not be ruled out. Rapid changes in the early successional stages have potentially long-term consequences on successional patterns through processes such as the modulation of germination and early establishment success of seedlings from later successional species. Quantitative data as those presented here are essential for the development of ecosystem management prescriptions. On Anticosti Island, reduction of local deer densities to levels {\textless}15-7.5 deer km(-2) in the first 3 years following timber harvesting appears to be compatible with the regeneration dynamics of this system although lower levels of deer densities may be required for the conservation of browse-sensitive plant species.},

abstract = {Red sea urchins, Strongylocentrotus franciscanus , were tagged with tetracycline in 1990 at subtidal sites off San Nicolas Island, California, USA. After one year in the field, the sea urchins were collected and growth increments were measured based on tetracycline marks, which indicated initial slow growth, a maximum rate, and finally a prolonged period of very slow growth. Small red sea urchins (4 cm diam) were estimated to be 3 to 4 yr old, which is much older than has previously been reported. It is estimated that about 12 yr would be required to attain 10 cm diam. Survival has previously been modeled assuming a constant rate. If the population of red sea urchins is assumed to be stable and stationary, annual survival rate was between 71 and 77{\%} yr -1 . Census data for the two years of study have permitted annual survival to be estimated without assuming stable and stationary population structure. Under these conditions, annual survival rate was between 79 and 86{\%} yr -1 . Analysis of transitions in the size distributions from 1990 to 1991 suggested that annual survival may have been sizespecific: 91{\%} yr -1 for individuals 1.1 to 4.0 cm diam, 82{\%} yr -1 for individuals 4.1 to 7.0 cm diam, and 63{\%} yr -1 for those of 7.1 to 10.0 cm diam. An alternative explanation to size-specific survival in our study is sizespecific immigration.},

abstract = {Environmental disturbances can alter the variability of assemblages of organisms in impacted sites compared to control sites. It has therefore been proposed that increased variability might be an important feature of stressed populations. Increased variability may be due to changes in the population structure of individual species or changes in the suite of species. In this study, spatial variances of shallow subtidal assemblages of organisms inhabiting vertical cliff-faces were compared among two control locations and one location that had for many yeats been exposed to the discharge of sewage. These assemblages covered nearly all available space on the substratum and consisted primarily of encrusting and foliose macro-algae and numerous filter-feeding animals, such as ascidians, sponges and bryozoans. Mean differences in abundances between these locations were investigated using Beyond BACI designs. In addition, these locations were used to examine the model that assemblages are more variable in disturbed than undisturbed environments and to try to distinguish differences in variability due to differences in the population structure of individual species from that due to changes in species composition. The assemblages were sampled at two spatial scales at each of three depths in each location. There were significant differences between the polluted location and one or other of the control locations in the mean abundances of some organisms, the variances of certain species (or recognisable types) at each spatial scale and for multivariate measures of species composition. There was, however, no evidence to support the prediction of increased variability in the apparently polluted location compared to the control locations. Importantly, for many measures of abundance and variability, the control locations were as different from each other as they were from the polluted location, suggesting that the latter fell within the range of natural subtidal assemblages separated by these spatial scales. These findings emphasise the need to include more than one control location in any study of a potential environmental impact, so that any effects of that impact can be distinguished from the range of natural variability.},

abstract = {We describe dramatic shifts in the species composition of the marine fish community of the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a 35-year time series of catch rates in an annual bottom-trawl survey. We attempt to understand the causes of these changes using a traits-based approach that relates the similarity among species in their abundance trends to similarities in their ecological traits. We selected traits based on a priori beliefs of how each should reflect susceptibility to changes in a different external factor potentially affecting the community. We found evidence for an effect of ocean climate and top-down effects of fishing and seal predation, but not for bottom-up effects of prey availability on adult fishes. Mean body length in the community decreased dramatically in the 1990s. This reflected the removal of large-bodied fishes by fishing and sharp increases in the abundance of small fishes. The biomass of small fish was inversely correlated with an index of predation on those fish by larger fish, suggesting strong predator control of the abundance of small-bodied fishes. Our results suggest that changes in ocean climate combined with direct and indirect effects of harvesting can dramatically and rapidly alter the composition of marine fish communities.Nous d{\'{e}}crivons des changements importants de composition sp{\'{e}}cifique dans les communaut{\'{e}}s de poissons marins du sud du golfe du Saint-Laurent {\`{a}} partir d'une s{\'{e}}rie chronologique de 35 ann{\'{e}}es de taux de captures dans des inventaires annuels au chalut de fond.

abstract = {The ecosystem approach to fisheries recognises the interdependence between harvested species and other ecosystem components. It aims to account for the propagation of the effects of harvesting through the food-web. The formulation and evaluation of ecosystem-based management strategies requires reliable models of ecosystem dynamics to predict these effects. The krill-based system in the Southern Ocean was the focus of some of the earliest models exploring such effects. It is also a suitable example for the development of models to support the ecosystem approach to fisheries because it has a relatively simple food-web structure and progress has been made in developing models of the key species and interactions, some of which has been motivated by the need to develop ecosystem-based management. Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is the main target species for the fishery and the main prey of many top predators. It is therefore critical to capture the processes affecting the dynamics and distribution of krill in ecosystem dynamics models. These processes include environmental influences on recruitment and the spatially variable influence of advection. Models must also capture the interactions between krill and its consumers, which are mediated by the spatial structure of the environment. Various models have explored predator-prey population dynamics with simplistic representations of these interactions, while others have focused on specific details of the interactions. There is now a pressing need to develop plausible and practical models of ecosystem dynamics that link processes occurring at these different scales. Many studies have highlighted uncertainties in our understanding of the system, which indicates future priorities in terms of both data collection and developing methods to evaluate the effects of these uncertainties on model predictions. We propose a modelling approach that focuses on harvested species and their monitored consumers and that evaluates model uncertainty by using alternative structures and functional forms in a Monte Carlo framework.},

abstract = {An important unanswered question in ecology is whether processes such as species interactions that occur at a local scale can generate large-scale patterns seen in nature. Because of the complexity of natural ecosystems, developing an adequate theoretical framework to scale up local processes has been challenging. Models of complex systems can produce a wide array of outcomes; therefore, model parameter values must be constrained by empirical information to usefully narrow the range of predicted behaviour. Under some conditions, spatially explicit models of locally interacting objects (for example, cells, sand grains, car drivers, or organisms), variously termed cellular automata or interacting particle models, can self-organize to develop complex spatial and temporal patterning at larger scales in the absence of any externally imposed pattern. When these models are based on transition probabilities of moving between ecological states at a local level, relatively complex versions of these models can be linked readily to empirical information on ecosystem dynamics. Here, I show that an empirically derived cellular automaton model of a rocky intertidal mussel bed based on local interactions correctly predicts large-scale spatial patterns observed in nature.},

The search for general principles underlying the internal organization of such systems often uses bottom-up simulation models such as cellular automata and agent-based models. No general framework for designing, testing, and analyzing bottom-up models has yet been established, but recent advances in ecological modeling have come together in a general strategy we call pattern-oriented modeling. This strategy provides a unifying framework for decoding the internal organization of agent-based complex systems and may lead toward unifying algorithmic theories of the relation between adaptive behavior and system complexity.},

abstract = {Dramatic shifts in the species composition of the Georges Bank fish community have occurred during the past 30 years. The bottomfish community, once dominated by cod, haddock, and flounder, shifted to lower-value species such as skates and dogfish. Herring and mackerel declined during the 1960s and 1970s, but have since recovered to record levels. These shifts are attributed {\textperiodcentered}primarily to high fishing pressure, but predation is the largest source of pre-recruit mortality, and is also considered important in controlling the dynamics of the fish community. Prior studies have identified the important predators as cod, silver hake, and spiny dogfish. Herring, mackerel, silver hake, and yellowtail flounder all experience high predation mortality, especially in the first and second years of life. To construct dynamic production models of the Georges Bank fish community, we aggre{\_}gated the dominant species into four groups: gadoids, flat fishes, pelagics, and elasmobranchs. Inclusion of species interactions in the dynamic models was based on statistical fits to the biomass data and groundtruthed with known species interactions. The most important in teractions are predation of gadoids and elasmobranchs on pelagics and apparent competition between gadoids and elasmobranchs. Equilibrium yields of each group depend on the abundances and hence the exploitation rates of the other species. Harvest strategies are simulated for both the multispecies model and the corresponding single-species equations, to illustrate the sensitivity of medium-term projections to species interactions.},

The fishery took off in the late 1980s as a result of expanding export markets, but has experienced substantial decline in landings since 1992 because of large decreases in urchin stock abundance. Fishery-independent surveys have not been conducted, and no formal stock assessment has been done prior to this study. Using the data collected from the fishery and urchin life history parameters derived from scientific studies, we conducted a formal stock assessment for the urchin stock. A stochastic observation-error length-structured model is used to describe the dynamics of the sea urchin population. A robust Bayesian approach is used for estimating fishery parameters because of concerns of possible outliers in fisheries data and mis-specification of priors. This study shows that the current stock is only 10{\%} of the virgin stock biomass and that the exploitation rate is close to 40{\%} suggesting that a large reduction in exploitation rate is necessary. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Predictions based on theory of multiple stable states suggest that larger perturbations should lead to more unpredictable patterns of succession. This prediction was tested in the Gulf of Maine using data from 60 intertidal plots of varying size that were experimentally cleared of the rockweed Ascophyllum nodosum and from 14 benchmark sites from throughout the Gulf. Rockweed was removed from the experimental clearings ranging from 1 to 8??m in diameter in 1996 and data collected in 2004 were used to test effects of clearing size and location on divergence and variability in species composition. Benchmark data were collected in 2005, and the 14 sites were from a dataset on 53 sites throughout the Gulf of Maine. The selected sites were randomly chosen from all sites with {\textgreater} 80{\%} canopy cover by A. nodosum and were expected to be similar to uncleared control plots from the experiment. Experimental removal of A. nodosum resulted in clearings at 12 sites within 4 bays. Abundances of gastropods, barnacles, mussels, and fucoid algae and the percentage cover of barnacles, mussels, fucoid algae, bare space, and other species were sampled. CAP and PERMDISP analyses revealed significant differences in multivariate dispersion and variability with both clearing size and location. Variability generally increased with clearing size and location effects were related to the north-south positioning of the sites. Benchmark sites were similar to the experimental control plots but as variable as the largest clearings. Results suggest that succession in larger clearings has been more unpredictable than in small clearings. The pattern of variability in the experimental clearings is consistent with the predictions of multiple stable states. However, the large amount of variation among the benchmark sites was due to mussels and was unexpected. This unexpected variability underscores the importance of sampling benchmark sites as part of experiments. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We have constructed an "expert-knowledge classification system" to categorize 309 fish taxa in the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations ichthyoplankton database into primary (coastal, coastal-oceanic, and oceanic) assemblages based on their principal ecological domains and subsequently, secondary assemblages according to the habitat affinities of adults. We examined effects of fishing, climate, adult habitat, and age-at-maturation on long-term variation of fish populations. We tested the hypothesis that populations of unexploited taxa track climatic trends more closely than those of exploited taxa insofar as climatic signals may be confounded by fishing effects. Most oceanic taxa (23/34) showed a significant relationship with environmental variables and followed the trend of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Very few coastal (3/10) and coastal-oceanic (3/23) taxa exhibited a significant relationship with environmental signals; however, several fluctuated coherently, and age-at-maturation is an important factor. The lack of close correlation between fish populations and environmental signals in the coastal and coastal-oceanic assemblages indicates that these species might show nonlinear biological responses to external forcing rather than a simple linear tracking of environmental variables. We did not find a systematic pattern indicating that fishing influenced population fluctuation of exploited species. Constrained comparisons of exploited to unexploited species living in the same habitat and reaching maturity at the same age revealed evidence of overexploitation for some species but not for all. Our results suggest that considering life history and ecological characteristics of fish species and applying a community approach are important in understanding fishing effects on fish populations in the context of a changing environment. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The relationship is also complex, because the concept of stability is multifaceted; different types of stability describing different properties of ecosystems lead to multiple diversity-stability relationships. A growing number of empirical studies demonstrate positive diversity-stability relationships. These studies, however, have emphasized only a few types of stability, and they rarely uncover the mechanisms responsible for stability. Because anthropogenic changes often affect stability and diversity simultaneously, diversity-stability relationships cannot be understood outside the context of the environmental drivers affecting both. This shifts attention away from diversity-stability relationships toward the multiple factors, including diversity, that dictate the stability of ecosystems.},

Here we investigated the role of physical disturbance and increased nutrients on reefs dominated by the canopy-forming kelp Ecklonia radiata. We combined experimental kelp canopy removals and additional nutrient at three different locations in a large embayment in temperate southeastern Australia. Over the following winter recruitment season, Ecklonia recruitment was unaffected by increased nutrients alone, but tripled at all sites where the canopy had been removed. At one site, the combination of disturbance and increased nutrients resulted in more than four times the recruitment of the introduced kelp Undaria pinnatifida. Six months after disturbance, the proliferation of the Undaria canopy in the canopy-removal and nutrient-addition treatment negatively influenced the recovery of the native kelp Ecklonia. Given the otherwise competitive dominance of adult Ecklonia, this provides a mechanism whereby Undaria could maintain open space for the following recruitment season. This interplay between disturbance, nutrients and the response of native and invasive species makes a compelling case for how a combination of factors can influence species dynamics.},

abstract = {We used time series of biomass and catches for the major commercial groundfish stocks in the Eastern Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands region and in the Gulf of Alaska to compute annual surplus production for 1977-2004. Annual surplus production and average annual biomass were aggregated across stocks within each region to examine the relationship between total surplus production and total aggregated biomass. We fit two surplus production models (Graham-Schaefer and Pella-Tomlinson) to the observed relationships to estimate maximum multi-species surplus production (equivalent to maximum sustainable yield) of the groundfish complexes in these ecosystems. Maximum multi-species surplus production was estimated to be approximately 2.5 ?? 106 t in the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands and 330 ?? 103 t in the Gulf of Alaska. These point estimates were smaller than the sum of single-species MSY proxies from recent stock assessments, and estimates for the Gulf of Alaska were much smaller than earlier estimates that were used to specify optimum yield ranges for the Gulf of Alaska groundfish complex. Therefore, optimum yield ranges for the Gulf of Alaska may need to be re-assessed to reflect more recent conditions. We further estimated the effects of environmental variability on annual surplus production using correlations and generalized surplus production models with environmental covariates. Results suggest that surplus production in the Bering Sea may be lower during conditions associated with the positive phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which is characterized by warmer temperatures, reduced ice, and reduced wind mixing over the shelf. Similarly, surplus production on the Gulf of Alaska shelf was lower during years with warm bottom temperatures coupled with low salinities in late winter. If maximum multi-species surplus production varies as a result of environmental variability, optimum yield ranges for the groundfish complexes in these ecosystems should take such fluctuations into account. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The reintroduction and recolonization of species extirpated from former ranges are key components of species conservation. Resource availability affects recolonization success and resulting distribution patterns, but top-down processes may also play a role through density-mediated or trait-mediated indirect effects that may exclude a species from otherwise suitable habitat. We predicted that the spatial distribution of recolonizing sea otters, Enhydra lutris, on the Canadian Pacific coastline was explained by resources as well as interspecific interactions - spatial segregation from pinnipeds, the preferred prey of killer whales Orcinus orca. We surveyed the summer occurrence of sea otters and pinnipeds on Vancouver Island, Canada. We quantified coastline density and bathymetry at multiple spatial scales as indices of habitat complexity and foraging habitat availability. We used generalized linear model selection to test hypotheses about sea otters' spatial relationship to resources and heterospecifics. Pinniped presence negatively predicted sea otter presence, even after accounting for complexity and foraging habitat. Sea otters may segregate from pinnipeds due to trait-mediated indirect effects of predation, leading us to hypothesize apparent competition between sea otters and pinnipeds. Research is needed to test this hypothesis; if true, refuge from apparent competitors may be a key component of recolonization habitat for sea otters. Species distribution models should quantify resource landscapes but also species-scapes: the spatial plane of species interactions that combines with resources to drive species distributions. Conservation plans based on recolonization models that include only resources may overestimate available habitat, carrying capacity, and recolonization success. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The Benguela upwelling system off south-western Africa supports sardine Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus that are harvested by purse-seine fisheries and are the main prey of three endemic seabirds: African Penguin Spheniscus demersus, Cape Gannet Morus capensis and Cape Cormorant Phalacrocorax capensis. There have been large, long-term changes in the abundance and distribution of the fish resources that have influenced seabird populations. After 1956/1957, the numbers of penguins and gannets breeding in Namibia decreased by 90{\%} and 95{\%}, respectively. After 1978/1979, the number of Cape Cormorants breeding in Namibia decreased by 76{\%}. These decreases were significantly related to the biomass of sardine and anchovy in Namibia and are thought to result mainly from a greatly reduced availability of prey. In South Africa, when the sardine collapsed, it was replaced by anchovy. In the Western Cape, the numbers of Cape Gannets and Cape Cormorants were stable after the collapse of the sardine but African Penguins decreased. The sardine resource recovered in the 1980s and 1990s but, at the turn of the century, was displaced to the east, leading to increases and then decreases in the numbers of penguins and gannets in the Western Cape. In the Eastern Cape, there were long-term increases in the numbers of penguins and gannets, until a recent decrease in penguins. In South Africa, the models used to advise allowable catches for sardine and anchovy are being modified to incorporate a model of African Penguins and functional relationships linking penguins and fish stocks. Consideration is also being given to precluding fishing in areas around seabird breeding colonies.},

In a high-resolution dataset spanning 8 years, pH at a north-temperate coastal site declined with increasing atmospheric CO(2) levels and varied substantially in response to biological processes and physical conditions that fluctuate over multiple time scales. Applying a method to link environmental change to species dynamics via multispecies Markov chain models reveals strong links between in situ benthic species dynamics and variation in ocean pH, with calcareous species generally performing more poorly than noncalcareous species in years with low pH. The models project the long-term consequences of these dynamic changes, which predict substantial shifts in the species dominating the habitat as a consequence of both direct effects of reduced calcification and indirect effects arising from the web of species interactions. Our results indicate that pH decline is proceeding at a more rapid rate than previously predicted in some areas, and that this decline has ecological consequences for near shore benthic ecosystems.},

abstract = {Patterns of climate-forced range shift in the marine environment are informed by investigating the population dynamics of an ecologically important sea urchin ( Centrostephanus rodgersii– Diadematidae) across its newly extended range in Tasmania (southeastern Australia). A growth model of C. rodgersii is developed allowing estimation of a sea urchin age profile and, in combination with abundance data, we correlate the sea urchin population dynamic with respect to environmental signals across the range extension region. Growth patterns did not vary across the extension region; however, there was a strong pattern of decreasing sea urchin age with increasing distance from the historic range. The sequential poleward discovery of the sea urchin, a pattern of declining age and a general poleward reduction in abundance along the eastern Tasmanian coastline are consistent with a model of range extension driven by recent change in patterns of larval dispersal. We explore this hypothesis by correlating C. rodgersii population characteristics with respect to the East Australian Current (EAC), i.e. the chief vector for poleward larval dispersal, and reveal patterns of declining sea urchin age and abundance with increasing distance from this oceanic feature. Furthermore, C. rodgersii is generally limited to sites where average winter temperatures are warmer than the cold threshold for its larval development. Potential dispersal and physiological mechanisms defining the range extension appear to be strongly coupled to the EAC which has undergone recent poleward advance and resulted in coastal warming in eastern Tasmania. Predicted climate change conditions for this region will favour continued population expansion of C. rodgersii not only via atmospheric-forced ocean warming, but also via ongoing intensification of the EAC driving continued poleward supply of larvae and heat.

abstract = {Abstract Climate models predict a dramatic increase in the annual frequency and severity of extreme weather events during the next century. Here we show that increases in the annual frequency of severe storms lead to a decrease in the diversity and complexity of food webs of giant kelp forests, one of the most productive habitats on Earth. We demonstrate this by linking natural variation in storms with measured changes in kelp forest food web structure in the Santa Barbara Channel using structural equation modeling (SEM). We then match predictions from statistical models to results from a multiyear kelp removal experiment designed to simulate frequent large storms. Both SEM models and experiments agree: if large storms remain at their current annual frequency (roughly one major kelp-removing storm every 3.5 years), periodic storms help maintain the complexity of kelp forest food webs. However, if large storms increase in annual frequency and begin to occur year after year, kelp forest food webs become less diverse and complex as species go locally extinct. The loss of complexity occurs primarily due to decreases in the diversity and complexity of higher trophic levels. Our findings demonstrate that shifts in climate-driven disturbances that affect foundation species are likely to have impacts that cascade through entire ecosystems.},

abstract = {The fishery can be divided into two subfisheries (‘spawning' and ‘non-spawning'). Commercial catch rates for the ‘non-spawning' subfishery declined from the late 1980s to 1997, whereas those for the ‘spawning' subfishery exhibit no obvious temporal trend. An ‘Integrated Analysis' assessment, of the feasibility of reconciling these differing trends, uses catch (landed and discarded), catch rate, length-at-age, and catch-at-age data and estimates of absolute abundance based on the egg-production method. It emphasizes uncertainty due to model assumptions and the data included in the assessment. Use of the discard data allows more precise estimation of the magnitude of recent recruitments. Spawning biomass is estimated to have declined from a peak in 1989–91 to 1999 although fishing mortality has consistently been {\textless}6{\%}for each subfishery. One main reason for the reduction in population size is the weakness of year-classes spawned from 1988 to 1993. Differences in catch rates between the two subfisheries can therefore be explained by interactions between the components of the population harvested by the two ‘subfisheries', and the trends in year-class strength. A risk analysis is used to evaluate the consequences of different future levels of harvest for different assessment assumptions. Overall, the spawning biomass is predicted to increase over the next five to ten years as a result of the strong 1994 and 1995 year-classes, although the extent of this increase remains uncertain.},

abstract = {Question: How does the ability to improve foraging skills by learning, and to transfer that learned knowledge, affect the development of intra-population foraging specializations? Features of the model: We use both a state-dependent life-history model implemented by stochastic dynamic programming (SDPM) and an individual-based model (IBM) to capture the dynamic nature of behavioural preferences in feeding. Variables in the SDPM include energy reserves, skill levels, energy and handling time per single prey item, metabolic rate, the rates at which skills are learned and forgotten, the effect of skills on handling time, and the relationship between energy reserves and fitness. Additional variables in the IBM include the probability of successful weaning, the logistic dynamics of the prey species with stochastic recruitment, the intensity of top-down control of prey by predators, the mean and variance in skill levels of new recruits, and the extent to which learned information can be transmitted via matrilineal social learning. Key range of variables: We explore the effects of approaching the time horizon in the SDPM, changing the extent to which skills can improve with experience, increasing the rates of learning or forgetting of skills, changing whether the learning curve is constant, accelerating ('J'-shaped) or decelerating ('r'-shaped), changing both mean and maximum possible energy reserves, changing metabolic costs of foraging, and changing the rate of encounter with prey. Conclusions: The model results show that the following factors increase the degree of prey specialization observed in a predator population: (1) Experience handling a prey type can substantially improve foraging skills for that prey. (2) There is limited ability to retain complex learned skills for multiple prey types. (3) The learning curve for acquiring new foraging skills is accelerating, or J-shaped. (4) The metabolic costs of foraging are high relative to available energy reserves. (5) Offspring can learn foraging skills from their mothers (matrilineal social learning). (6) Food abundance is limited, such that average individual energy reserves are low Additionally, the following factors increase the likelihood of alternative specializations co-occurring in a predator population: (1) The predator exerts effective top-down control of prey abundance, resulting in frequency-dependent dynamics. (2) There is stochastic variation in prey population dynamics, but this variation is neither too extreme in magnitude nor too 'slow' with respect to the time required for an individual forager to learn new foraging skills. For a given predator population, we deduce that the degree of specialization will be highest for those prey types requifing complex capture or handling skills, while prey species that are both profitable and easy to capture and handle will be included in the diet of all individuals. Frequency-dependent benefits of selecting alternative prey types, combined with the ability of foragers to improve their foraging skills by learning, and transmit learned skills to offspring, can result in behaviourally mediated foraging specialization, and also lead to the co-existence of alternative specializations. The extent of such specialization is predicted to be a variable trait, increasing in locations or years when intra-specific competition is high relative to inter-specific competition.},

abstract = {To better understand the spatial distribution of recruitment in the northern California red sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) population, we sampled size distributions at each of 12 locations in 1995 and 1996, two of those locations in 1994, and 5 of those locations in 1997. An index of recent recruitment in these size distributions and an estimate of density of recent recruitment reflect a similar spatial pattern of recruitment. This pattern appears to be determined by the effect of coastal circulation on larval delivery during relaxation of upwelling, and not the result of the positive effect of the adult spine canopy on juvenile survival. Recent recruitment of red sea urchins in northern California is higher in areas more frequently subjected to onshore and poleward flow during relaxation of upwelling. These results are consistent with a mechanism by which alongshore spatial variability in southward, offshore flow during upwelling winds allows larvae to maintain latitudinal position, whereas flows during event-scale relaxations in upwelling winds serve to distribute settling larvae alongshore, favouring areas north of promontories. The consequent spatial pattern of red sea urchin settlement varies from year to year, and there are not yet sufficient data to demonstrate the degree to which this spatial pattern in recruitment determines a spatial pattern in fishable adult abundance.},

abstract = {It is well known that current equilibrium-based models fall short as predictive descriptions of natural ecosystems, and particularly of fisheries systems that exhibit nonlinear dynamics. For example, model parameters assumed to be fixed constants may actually vary in time, models may fit well to existing data but lack out-of-sample predictive skill, and key driving variables may be misidentified due to transient (mirage) correlations that are common in nonlinear systems. With these frailties, it is somewhat surprising that static equilibrium models continue to be widely used. Here, we examine empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) as an alternative to imposed model equations and that accommodates both nonequilibrium dynamics and nonlinearity. Using time series from nine stocks of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) from the Fraser River system in British Columbia, Canada, we perform, for the the first time to our knowledge, real-data comparison of contemporary fisheries models with equivalent EDM formulations that explicitly use spawning stock and environmental variables to forecast recruitment. We find that EDM models produce more accurate and precise forecasts, and unlike extensions of the classic Ricker spawner-recruit equation, they show significant improvements when environmental factors are included. Our analysis demonstrates the strategic utility of EDM for incorporating environmental influences into fisheries forecasts and, more generally, for providing insight into how environmental factors can operate in forecast models, thus paving the way for equation-free mechanistic forecasting to be applied in management contexts.},

abstract = {Natural ecological communities are continuously buffeted by a varying en-vironment, often making it difficult to measure the stability of communities using concepts requiring the existence of an equilibrium point. Instead of an equilibrium point, the equi-librial state of communities subject to environmental stochasticity is a stationary distri-bution, which is characterized by means, variances, and other statistical moments. Here, we derive three properties of stochastic multispecies communities that measure different characteristics associated with community stability. These properties can be estimated from multispecies time-series data using first-order multivariate autoregressive (MAR(1)) models. We demonstrate how to estimate the parameters of MAR(1) models and obtain confidence intervals for both parameters and the measures of stability. We also address the problem of estimation when there is observation (measurement) error. To illustrate these methods, we compare the stability of the planktonic communities in three lakes in which nutrient loading and planktivorous fish abundance were experimentally manipulated. MAR(1) mod-els and the statistical methods we present can be used to identify dynamically important interactions between species and to test hypotheses about stability and other dynamical properties of naturally varying ecological communities. Thus, they can be used to integrate theoretical and empirical studies of community dynamics.},

abstract = {Kelp forests (Order Laminariales) form key biogenic habitats in coastal regions of temperate and Arctic seas worldwide, providing ecosystem services valued in the range of billions of dollars annually. Although local evidence suggests that kelp forests are increasingly threatened by a variety of stressors, no comprehen-sive global analysis of change in kelp abundances currently exists. Here, we build and analyze a global database of kelp time series spanning the past half-century to assess regional and global trends in kelp abundances. We detected a high degree of geo-graphic variation in trends, with regional variability in the di-rection and magnitude of change far exceeding a small global average decline (instantaneous rate of change = −0.018 y −1). Our analysis identified declines in 38{\%} of ecoregions for which there are data (−0.015 to −0.18 y −1), increases in 27{\%} of ecoregions (0.015 to 0.11 y −1), and no detectable change in 35{\%} of ecore-gions. These spatially variable trajectories reflected regional dif-ferences in the drivers of change, uncertainty in some regions owing to poor spatial and temporal data coverage, and the dy-namic nature of kelp populations. We conclude that although global drivers could be affecting kelp forests at multiple scales, local stressors and regional variation in the effects of these drivers dominate kelp dynamics, in contrast to many other marine and terrestrial foundation species. kelp forest | Laminariales | global change | climate change | coastal ecosystems A ssessing ecosystem change on a global scale has been in-strumental in highlighting the magnitude of human impacts on natural ecosystems. For example, awareness of global declines in fish populations (1), coral reefs (2), and tropical rainforests (3) has substantially increased public interest and subsequent polit-ical motivation for environmental conservation. In some cases, global assessments have highlighted complex patterns of change (4, 5), which often reflect variable trajectories among regions (4). Significance Kelp forests support diverse and productive ecological communities throughout temperate and arctic regions world-wide, providing numerous ecosystem services to humans. Lit-erature suggests that kelp forests are increasingly threatened by a variety of human impacts, including climate change, overfishing, and direct harvest. We provide the first globally comprehensive analysis of kelp forest change over the past 50 y, identifying a high degree of variation in the magnitude and direction of change across the geographic range of kelps. These results suggest region-specific responses to global change, with local drivers playing an important role in driving patterns of kelp abundance. Increased monitoring aimed at un-derstanding regional kelp forest dynamics is likely to prove most effective for the adaptive management of these important ecosystems. Data deposition: The global database of kelp abundance time series has been published on the Kelp Ecosystem Ecology Network website (www.kelpecosystems.org/data/), and on the Temperate Reef Base website (temperatereefbase.imas.utas.edu.au/portal/search? uuid=ecbe5cc3-3fbf-4569-b5e8-07c2201fcb9c).

We combined field surveys and experimental manipulations to examine the consequences of changing predator diversity for trophic cascades in kelp forests. In field surveys we found that predator diversity was negatively correlated with herbivore abundance and positively correlated with kelp abundance. To assess whether this relationship was causal, we manipulated predator richness in kelp mesocosms, and found that decreasing predator richness increased herbivore grazing, leading to a decrease in the biomass of the giant kelp Macrocystis. The presence of different predators caused different herbivores to alter their behaviour by reducing grazing, such that total grazing was lowest at highest predator diversity. Our results suggest that declining predator diversity can have cascading effects on community structure by reducing the abundance of key habitat-providing species.},

abstract = {Little is known about the cumulative effects of multiple (Ͼ2) environmental controls on species performance and interactions in aquatic ecosystems. We asked how changes in climatic (temperature, ultraviolet radiation) and ecological controls (nutrients, grazing) affect recruitment of the green macroalga Enteromorpha intestinalis, which forms destructive algal blooms in coastal ecosystems worldwide. We designed factorial laboratory experiments to analyze the recruitment response to (1) single and combined effects of nutrient enrichment, grazing pressure, and grazer species composition and (2) the cumulative effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, temperature, nutrients, and grazing. Recruitment of E. intestinalis increased exponentially with nutrient enrichment. Grazers could control algal recruitment until a nutrient threshold was reached depending on grazer species composition. Snails (Littorina lit-torea) had strong negative effects on recruit density, whereas amphipods (Gammarus oceanicus) had weak grazing effects and favored algal recruitment through excretion when nutrient supply was low. Temperature and nutrients both enhanced algal recruitment but also the effects of grazers, which led to a significant three-way interaction among these factors. Similarly, effects of UV radiation depended on grazer presence and temperature. When grazers were absent, UV radiation reduced recruitment at 11 and 17ЊC but enhanced recruitment at 5ЊC. No effects were seen in the presence of grazers. Our results indicate that multiple human influences, such as climate change, eutrophication, and food web alterations, have interdependent effects and the potential for synergistically enhancing the development of macroalgal blooms in coastal ecosystems.},

This study develops critical reference points for sustainable management by using a large empirical dataset on the coral reefs of the western Indian Ocean to investigate associations between levels of target fish biomass (as an indicator of fishing intensity) and eight metrics of ecosystem state. These eight ecological metrics each exhibited specific thresholds along a continuum of fishable biomass ranging from heavily fished sites to old fisheries closures. Three thresholds lay above and five below a hypothesized window of fishable biomass expected to produce a maximum multispecies sustainable yield (B(MMSY)). Evaluating three management systems in nine countries, we found that unregulated fisheries often operate below the B(MMSY), whereas fisheries closures and, less frequently, gear-restricted fisheries were within or above this window. These findings provide tangible management targets for multispecies coral reef fisheries and highlight key tradeoffs required to achieve different fisheries and conservation goals.},

abstract = {Predators are critical components of ecosystems. Globally, conservation efforts have targeted depleted populations of top predators for legal protection, and in many cases, this protection has helped their recoveries. Where the recovery of individual species is the goal, these efforts can be seen as largely successful. From an ecosystem perspective, however, predator recovery can introduce significant new conservation and legal challenges. We highlight three types of conflicts created by a single-species focus: (1) recovering predator populations that increase competition with humans for the same prey, (2) new tradeoffs that emerge when protected predators consume protected prey, and (3) multiple predator populations that compete for the same limited prey. We use two food webs with parallel conservation challenges, the Northeast Pacific Ocean and the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem, to demonstrate legal/policy conflicts and the policy levers that exist to ameliorate conflicts. In some cases, scientific uncertainty about the ecological interaction hinders progress towards resolving conflicts. In others, available policy options are insufficient. In all cases, management decisions must be made in the face of an unknown future. We suggest a framework that incorporates multispecies science, policy tools, and tradeoff analyses into management.},

We then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view, that each emphasizes different processes of potential importance in metacommunities. These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone.},

The spatial distribution of catch and effort is based on a simplification of the Baranov catch equation, the relationship between fishing efficiency and local fishing effort (interference), and the assumptions of the ideal free distribution.

abstract = {The understorey beneath a canopy of the kelp Ecklonia radiata often contains juvenile sporophytes of the same species. When canopy disturbance occurs, these juvenile sporophytes are exposed to new environmental conditions. If these juvenile sporophytes survive these new conditions, then they become a ready source of kelps to rapidly form a new canopy. This study investigated the potential of pre-existing juvenile sporophytes of E. radiata to survive post-disturbance conditions and contribute to the rapid formation of a new canopy. The potential of canopy recovery by recruitment of kelp from zoospores was also investigated. These processes were studied at different times during the summer and on reefs ranging in topographic complexity from simple, flat reefs to highly complex, rugose reefs. By tagging juvenile sporophytes after the adult kelp canopy was removed and monitoring them through time, it was demonstrated that most juveniles ({\textgreater} 50{\%}) survived the change in conditions after canopy loss, with some juveniles going on to become members of a new canopy. Approximately 6-47{\%} of tagged sporophytes died within 3-4??days after canopy removal possibly due to excessive photoinhibition and photostress as demonstrated by changes in photosynthetic performance (decreased alpha values) of juveniles. The potential contribution of juvenile sporophytes to the rapid formation of a new canopy appears to be dependent on the timing of canopy removal with late summer-autumn canopy loss favouring faster recovery. Topographically complex reefs had less short-term (7??days) survival of juvenile sporophytes than topographically simple reefs; however this difference was not carried through to the long-term (6??months) abundance of adult kelp in experimental clearings, which was greater on topographically complex reefs. Clearly, juvenile sporophytes in arrested development under existing canopies of the small kelp E. radiata are important for the rapid recovery of the kelp canopy once adults are lost through physical disturbance. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

While the use of more advanced statistical methods has helped catch rates to be standardised against many explanatory variables, the changing spatial characteristics of most fisheries data sets provide additional challenges for constructing reliable indices of stock abundance. After reviewing the use of general linear models to construct indices of annual stock abundance, potential biases which can arise due to the unequal and changing nature of the spatial distribution of fishing effort are examined and illustrated through the analysis of simulated data. Finally, some options are suggested for modelling catch rates in unfished strata and for accounting for the uncertainties in the stock and fishery dynamics which arise in the interpretation of spatially varying catch rate data. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Balanced harvesting, where species or individuals are exploited in accordance with their productivity, has been proposed as a way to minimize the effects of fishing on marine fish communities and ecosystems. This calls for a thorough examination of the consequences balanced harvesting has on fish community structure and yield. We use a size- and trait-based model that resolves individual interactions through competition and predation to compare balanced harvesting with traditional selective harvesting, which protects juvenile fish from fishing. Four different exploitation patterns, generated by combining selective or unselective harvesting with balanced or unbalanced fishing, are compared. We find that unselective balanced fishing, where individuals are exploited in proportion to their productivity, produces a slightly larger total maximum sustainable yield than the other exploitation patterns and, for a given yield, the least change in the relative biomass composition of the fish community. Because fishing reduces competition, predation and cannibalism within the community, the total maximum sustainable yield is achieved at high exploitation rates. The yield from unselective balanced fishing is dominated by small individuals, whereas selective fishing produces a much higher proportion of large individuals in the yield. Although unselective balanced fishing is predicted to produce the highest total maximum sustainable yield and the lowest impact on trophic structure, it is effectively a fishery predominantly targeting small forage fish.},

Growth rates were somewhat lower than most previous reports for the species and suggested that most of the population was made up of 1 and 2 yr-old individuals. Diet consisted largely of geniculate coralline algae, with fleshy brown algae becoming important when available as drift. This study showed high densities of small urchins can exist in a California kelp forest inhabited by sea ot- ters, but regular recruitment may be necessary to main- tain such populations.},

abstract = {Synthesizing long-term observations at multiple scales is vital for understanding the environmental drivers of ecosystem dynamics. We assessed the role of several environmental drivers in explaining temporal and spatial patterns in the abundance of giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera in the Santa Barbara Channel between 1984 and 2009. We developed a novel method for estimating the canopy biomass of giant kelp from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper satellite imagery, which allowed us to examine the dynamics of giant-kelp biomass on spatial scales ranging from 100s of m 2 to 100s of km 2 and temporal scales ranging from several weeks to 25 yr. Comparisons of changes in canopy biomass with oceanographic and climatic data revealed that winter losses of regional kelp canopy biomass were positively correlated with significant wave height (r 2 = 0.50), while spring recoveries were negatively correlated with sea surface temperature (r 2 = 0.30; used as a proxy for nutrient availability). On interannual timescales, regional kelp-canopy biomass lagged the variations in wave heights, sea surface temperatures, and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation index by 3 yr, indicating that these factors affect cycles of kelp recruitment and mortality. Results from cluster analysis showed that the response of kelp biomass to environmental conditions varied among different subregions of the Santa Barbara Channel. The dynamics of kelp biomass in exposed regions were related to wave disturbance, while kelp dynamics in sheltered regions tracked sea surface temperatures more closely. These results depict a high level of regional heterogeneity in the biomass dynamics of this important foundation species. ¬{\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2011.},

These ecosystems are changing rapidly usually in response to anthropogenic changes in the environment. To determine the likely impact of environmental change on ecosystems and the best ways to manage them, it would be desirable to be able to predict their future states. We present a proposal to develop the paradigm of predictive systems ecology, explicitly to understand and predict the properties and behaviour of ecological systems. We discuss the necessary and desirable features of predictive systems ecology models. There are places where predictive systems ecology is already being practised and we summarize a range of terrestrial and marine examples. Significant challenges remain but we suggest that ecology would benefit both as a scientific discipline and increase its impact in society if it were to embrace the need to become more predictive.},

abstract = {Multispecies fishery assessment models may be divided into two general categories: those involving analyses of the trophic interdependence of species (biological interactions) and those addressing the question of co-occu rrence in fishing gear (technological interactions). Certainly, both categories of interactions may occur simultaneously. Nevertheless, the latter class of models is probably adequate if major species of interest exhibit a high degree of mutually exclusive food resource partitioning, and interspecific competition for food is low. In this study, multispecies analogs of the Thompson-Bell yield-per-recruit model are developed for alternative situations in which species groups (assemblages) are exploited solely by one fishery, and when several fisheries (defined by gear type, seasonal changes in species mix, etc). exploit the same species concurrently and/or sequentially. Species included in the analyses are assumed to have negligible trophic dependence. Equilibrium fishery yields (in aggregate and for individual species) are computed as functions of standardized effort levels and retention characteristics of gear (e.g. mesh sine). The multiple fishery model allows for variable harvest strategies with respect to gear selectivity and effort levels among component fisheries. Simultation output includes total and individual equilibrium species yields, exploitation rates, and mean fish weights in the catch for all fisheries combined, and each separatery. Applications of the models are illustrated for mixed-species otter trawl fisheries exploiting primarily Atlantic cod, GaBIUs morkua, haddock, Melanogramrnus aeglefinus, yellovvtail flounder, Limanda ferruginea, and winter flounder, Pseudspleuroneetes americanus, in the Georges Bank region off the northeastern United States. Results emphasize the potential for growth underfishing or overfishing of individual species/stocks when total system yield is the optimization criterion.},

Analysis of the population dynamics of the mussel Mytilus californianus taken in 16 plots over 18-years found no evidence that these processes explained observed strong fluctuations. Instead, population fluctuations arose because environmental stochasticity varied with abundance, which we term density-linked stochasticity. This phenomenon arises from biologically relevant mechanisms: recruitment variation and transmission of disturbance among neighboring individuals. Density-linked stochasticity is probably present frequently in populations, as it arises naturally from several general ecological processes, including stage structure variation with density, ontogenetic niche shifts, and local transmission of stochastic perturbations. More thoroughly characterizing and interpreting deviations from the mean behavior of a system will lead to better ecological prediction and improved insight into the important processes affecting populations and ecosystems.},

abstract = {Assumptions about the future productivity of a stock are necessary to calculate sus- tainable catches in fisheries management. Fisheries scientists often assume the num- ber of young fish entering a population (recruitment) is related to the biomass of spawning adults and that recruitment dynamics do not change over time. Thus, managers often use a target biomass based on spawning biomass as the basis for cal- culating sustainable catches. However, we show recruitment and spawning biomass are not positively related over the observed range of stock sizes for 61{\%} of 224 stocks in the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database. Furthermore, 85{\%} of stocks for which spawning biomass may not drive recruitment dynamics over the observed ranges exhibit shifts in average recruitment, which is often used in proxies for target biomasses. Our results suggest that the environment more strongly influences recruitment than spawning biomass over the observed stock sizes for many stocks. Management often endeavours to maintain stock sizes within the observed ranges, so methods for setting management targets that include changes within an ecosys- tem may better define the status of some stocks, particularly as climate changes.},

abstract = {A separable catch-age stock assessment model that accommodates predation mortality is applied to the Gulf of Alaska walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) assessment. Three predators are incorporated in the model: arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias), Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis), and Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus). The effect of these predators is examined by defining the predation mortality as a type of fishery. The model is used to quantify changes in the relative fit to the survey, fishery, and predator data when the assumption of constant natural mortality is relaxed. Specifically, we examine the effect of assumptions regarding the functional feeding response, residual naturaly mortality, and uncertainty in predator biomass on stock assessment. Total natural mortality rates (including predation) tended to be higher than estimated from life history characteristics of the stock. Models that did not account for uncertainty in natural mortality underestimated uncertainty in current stock biomass by as much as 20{\%}. Our results indicate that independent estimates of survey selectivity, additional food habits data, and estimates of the feeding responses of predators to different prey densities are all needed to improve our ability to develop stock assessment models that address ecosystem concerns.},

abstract = {Macroalgae are important primary producers in many subtidal habitats, yet little information exists on the temporal and spatial dynamics of net primary production (NPP) by entire subtidal assemblages. This knowledge gap reflects the logistical challenges in measuring NPP of diverse macroalgal assemblages in shallow marine habitats. Here, we couple a simple primary production model with nondestructive estimates of taxon-specific biomass on subtidal reefs off Santa Barbara, California to produce a 4-year time series of net primary production by intact assemblages of understory macroalgae in giant kelp forests off Santa Barbara, California, USA. Daily bottom irradiance varied significantly throughout the year, and algal assemblages were on average exposed to saturating irradiance for only 1.3–4.5 h per day, depending on the time of year. Despite these variable light-limiting conditions, biomass rather than irradiance explained the vast majority of variation observed in daily NPP at all times of the year. Measurements of peak biomass in spring and summer proved to be good predictors of NPP for the entire year, explaining as much as 76{\%} of the observed variation. In contrast, bottom irradiance was a poor predictor of NPP, explaining {\textless}10{\%} of the variation in NPP when analyzed seasonally and {\~{}}2{\%} when evaluated annually. Our finding that annual NPP by macroalgal assemblages can be predicted from a single, nondestructive measurement of biomass should prove useful for developing time series data that are necessary to evaluate natural and anthropogenic changes in NPP by one of the world's most productive ecosystems.},

However, a positive (or negative) association between two species does not necessarily signify a direct or indirect interaction, as it can result simply from the species having similar (or dissimilar) habitat requirements. We show how these two factors can be separated by multivariate logistic regression, with the regression part accounting for species-specific habitat requirements, and a correlation matrix for the positive or negative residual associations. We parameterize the model using Bayesian inference with data on 22 species of wood-decaying fungi acquired in 14 dissimilar forest sites. Our analyses reveal that some of the species commonly found to occur together in the same logs are likely to do so merely by similar habitat requirements, whereas other species combinations are systematically either over- or underrepresented also or only after accounting for the habitat requirements. We use our results to derive hypotheses on species interactions that can be tested in future experimental work.},

abstract = {An important principle of environmental science is that changes in single components of systems are likely to have consequences elsewhere in the same systems. In the sea, food web data are one of the few foundations for predicting such indirect effects, whether of fishery exploitation or following recovery in marine protected areas (MPAs). We review the available literature on one type of indirect interaction in benthic marine ecosystems, namely trophic cascades, which involve three or more trophic levels connected by predation, Because many indirect effects have been revealed through fishery exploitation, in some cases we include humans as trophic levels. Our purpose is to establish how widespread cascades might be, and infer how likely they are to affect the properties of communities following the implementation of MPAs or intensive resource exploitation We review 39 documented cascades (eight of which include humans as a trophic level) from 21 locations around the world; all but two of the cascades are from shallow systems underlain by hard substrata (kelp forests, rocky subtidal, coral reefs and rocky intertidal), We argue that these systems are well represented because they are accessible and also amenable to the type of work that is necessary, Nineteen examples come from the central-eastern and north-eastern Pacific, while no well-substantiated benthic cascades have been reported from the NE, CE or SW Atlantic, the Southern Oceans, E Indian Ocean or NW Pacific, The absence of examples from those zones is probably due to lack of study. Sea urchins are very prominent in the subtidal examples, and gastropods, especially limpets, in the intertidal examples; we suggest that this may reflect their predation by fewer specialist predators than is the case with fishes, but also their conspicuousness to investigators. The variation in ecological resolution amongst studies, and in intensity of study amongst systems and regions, indicates that more cascades will likely be identified in due course. Broadening the concept of cascades to include pathogenic interactions would immediately increase the number of examples. The existing evidence is that cascade effects are to be expected when hard-substratum systems are subject to artisanal resource exploitation, but that the particular problems of macroalgal overgrowth on Caribbean reefs and the expansion of coralline barrens in the Mediterranean rocky-sublittoral will not be readily reversed in MPAs, probably because factors other than predation-based cascades have contributed to them in the first place. More cascade effects are likely to be found in the soft-substratum systems that are crucial to so many large-scale fisheries, when opportunities such as those of MPAs and fishing gradients become available for study of such systems, and the search is widened to less conspicuous focal organisms such as polychaetes and crustaceans.},

abstract = {Assemblages of macroalgae are believe to be among the most productive ecosystems in the world, yet difficulties in obtaining direct estimates of biomass and primary production have led to few macroalgal data sets from which the consequences of long-term change can be assessed. We evaluated the validity of using two easily measured population variables (frond density and plant density) to estimate the more difficult to measure variables of standing crop and net primary production (NPP) in the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera off southern California. Standing crop was much more strongly correlated to frond density than to plant density. Frond density data collected in summer were particularly useful for estimating annual NPP, explaining nearly 80{\%} of the variation in the NPP from year to year. Data on frond densities also provided a relatively good estimate of seasonal NPP for the season that the data were collected. In contrast, estimates of seasonal and annual NPP derived from plant density data were less reliable. These results indicate that data on frond density collected at the proper time of year can make assessments of NPP by giant kelp more tractable. They also suggest that other easily measured variables that are strongly correlated with standing crop, such as surface canopy area, might serve as similarly useful proxies of NPP.},

abstract = {It is now clear that fished populations can fluctuate more than unharvested stocks. However, it is not clear why. Here we distinguish among three major competing mechanisms for this phenomenon, by using the 50-year California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) larval fish record. First, variable fishing pressure directly increases variability in exploited populations. Second, commercial fishing can decrease the average body size and age of a stock, causing the truncated population to track environmental fluctuations directly. Third, age-truncated or juvenescent populations have increasingly unstable population dynamics because of changing demographic parameters such as intrinsic growth rates. We find no evidence for the first hypothesis, limited evidence for the second and strong evidence for the third. Therefore, in California Current fisheries, increased temporal variability in the population does not arise from variable exploitation, nor does it reflect direct environmental tracking. More fundamentally, it arises from increased instability in dynamics. This finding has implications for resource management as an empirical example of how selective harvesting can alter the basic dynamics of exploited populations, and lead to unstable booms and busts that can precede systematic declines in stock levels.},

abstract = {For many marine species and habitats, climate change and overfishing present a double threat. To manage marine resources effectively, it is necessary to adapt management to changes in the physical environment. Simple relationships between environmental conditions and fish abundance have long been used in both fisheries and fishery management. In many cases, however, physical, biological, and human variables feed back on each other. For these systems, associations between variables can change as the system evolves in time. This can obscure relationships between population dynamics and environmental variability, undermining our ability to forecast changes in populations tied to physical processes. Here we present a methodology for identifying physical forcing variables based on nonlinear forecasting and show how the method provides a predictive understanding of the influence of physical forcing on Pacific sardine},

abstract = {* Ecosystem-based management of coral reef fisheries aims to sustainably deliver a diverse portfolio of ecosystem services. This goal can be undermined if the ecosystem shifts into a different state, with altered ecosystem functions and benefits to people. If levels of drivers that cause transitions between states are identified, management measures could be aimed at maintaining drivers below these levels to avoid ecosystem shifts. * Analysing data from a large number of Caribbean coral reefs (N = 2001), suites of nonlinear thresholds were identified between metrics of coral reef processes and structure along a gradient of total fish biomass (a proxy for fishing pressure). Several metrics (macroalgal cover, invertivorous fishes and fish species richness) associated with coral-dominated reefs exhibited thresholds at relatively high fish biomass levels (50–88{\%} of unfished biomass). Other metrics (urchin biomass, ratio of macroalgal to coral cover, herbivorous fishes and coral cover) showed thresholds at lower fish biomass levels (28–37{\%} of unfished biomass). * Ratios of total fish biomass in fishing areas to closed areas (unfished biomass) in the Caribbean indicate that reefs may generally be at risk for change at ratios between 0{\textperiodcentered}5 (coral dominated) and 0{\textperiodcentered}3 (macroalgal dominated). Similar relationships were found for coral reefs in the Indian Ocean. While these results illustrate thresholds at the scale of the entire Caribbean, assessing local reefs is advisable because biomass levels vary within the region, and reef trajectories depend on past, present and future local conditions. * Synthesis and applications. If the thresholds in this study are generalizable to scales relevant to management, it may be possible to produce sustainable yield while simultaneously maintaining coral-dominated reefs by restricting fishing mortality to levels that result in biomass ratios near 0{\textperiodcentered}5. Fishing down to biomass ratios near 0{\textperiodcentered}3 may increase the risk of overfishing (resulting in lower long-term yields) and transition to macroalgal-dominated reefs. Thresholds offer a simple and powerful way for managers to operationalize precautionary ecosystem-based fishery management by adaptively limiting fishing pressure in order to (i) maintain desirable coral reef conditions, (ii) establish a system-specific target for generating pretty good yield and (iii) maintain sustainable multi-species fishery yields.},

abstract = {The snow crab Chionoecetes opilio and Arctic lyre crab Hyas coarctatus are prominent members of the Chukchi Sea epifaunal community. A better understanding of their life history will aid in determining their role in this ecosystem in light of the changing climate and resource development. In this study, the size frequency distribution, growth, and mortality of these two crab species was examined in 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2013 to determine temporal and spatial patterns within the eastern Chukchi Sea, and to identify potential environmental drivers of the observed patterns. Temporally, the mean size of both sexes of C. opilio and H. coarctatus decreased significantly from 2009 to 2013, with the number of rare maximum sized organisms decreasing significantly to near absence in the latter two study years. Spatially, the mean size of male and female crabs of both species showed a latitudinal trend, decreasing from south to north in the investigation area. Growth of both sexes of C. opilio and H. coarctatus was linear over the sampled size range, and mortality was highest in the latter two study years. Life history features of both species related to different environmental parameters in different years, ranging from temperature, the sediment carbon to nitrogen ratio of the organic content, and sediment grain size distribution. Likely explanations for the observed temporal and spatial variability are ontogenetic migrations of mature crabs to warmer areas possibly due to cooler water temperatures in the latter two study years, or interannual fluctuations, which have been reported for C. opilio populations in other areas where successful waves of recruitment were estimated to occur in eight year intervals. Further research is suggested to determine if the spatial and temporal patterns found in this study are part of the natural variability in this system or if they are an indication of long-term trends.},

Among terrestrial vertebrates, 322 species have become extinct since 1500, and populations of the remaining species show 25{\%} average decline in abundance. Invertebrate patterns are equally dire: 67{\%} of monitored populations show 45{\%} mean abundance decline. Such animal declines will cascade onto ecosystem functioning and human well-being. Much remains unknown about this “Anthropocene defaunation”; these knowledge gaps hinder our capacity to predict and limit defaunation impacts.

The first three address well-studied community responses to environmental and ecological change: ecological communities are most likely to exhibit threshold changes in structure when perturbations cause large changes in limiting soil or sediment resources, dominant or keystone species, or attributes of disturbance regime that influence community recruitment. Four additional hypotheses address social-ecological interactions and apply to both ecological communities and social-ecological systems. Human responsiveness to short-term and local costs and benefits often leads to human actions with unintended long-term impacts, particularly those that are far from the site of decision making or are geographically dispersed. Policies are usually based on past conditions of ecosystem services rather than expected future trends. Finally, institutions that strengthen negative feedbacks between human actions and social-ecological consequences can reduce human impacts through more responsive (and thus more effective) management of public ecosystem services. Because of the large role that humans play in modifying ecosystems and ecosystem services, it is particularly important to test and improve social-ecological hypotheses as a basis for shaping appropriate policies for long-term ecosystem resilience.},

abstract = {There has been widespread concern that reduction in density of broadcast spawners by a fishery can have severe effects on reproduction. As fishing decreases density, fertilization efficiency declines, so that reproduction declines more rapidly than indicated by density, producing an Allee effect. However, this potentially precipitous decline in reproduction with declining density or stock size is not well understood at the population level. We used a simple deterministic model of the reproductive dynamics of a broadcast spawning invertebrate to show that the abrupt threshold often proposed as the form of this Allee effect is possible only when individuals are evenly spaced, and when sperm dispersal distribution is a constant out to a specified distance. When the spatial distribution is random and the sperm dispersal distribution is either Gaussian or exponential, fertilization success is linear up to 100{\%}; thus, zygote production is quadratic up to this density. As the width of the dispersal function decreases, fertilization reaches 100{\%} at higher densities, so that it may be beyond the highest density experienced by the population. In that case, zygote production is functionally linear. We then used a simulation model to assess the effects of aggregative behavior and stochastic variability in spatial patterns. We compared narrow and broad sperm dispersal distributions that were based on empirically determined fertilization of the green sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, under two flow regimes. Zygote production exhibited a gradual nonlinear Allee effect as density decreased for the broader gamete dispersal distribution, but a functionally linear relationship with a much lower slope for the narrower sperm dispersal distributions. Increasing aggregation increased the slope of both fertilization and zygote production vs. density at the origin, but they remained linear for the narrower distribution. High interannual variability in zygote production due to different spatial configurations suggested that the geometric mean of recruitment is a better indicator of population consequences than the arithmetic mean, and it displays a sharper threshold than the arithmetic mean. Our results imply that potential Allee effects at low density in broadcast spawning populations rarely exhibit threshold behavior, and that these Allee effects may be too weak to be detected in stock?recruitment relationships.},

Relative to more exposed rocky substrata at identical depths, bottoms beneath kelp canopies were exposed to weak fluid transport and were characterized by greater rates of deposition of particulates. A tracer particle experiment demonstrated that kelps inhibited transport of suspended particles from the overlying water column to the bottom. Thus, the higher rates of paniculate deposition beneath kelp canopies probably were caused by longer particle residence times and higher probabilities of paniculate redeposition beneath canopies and not by higher rates of particle import. These hydrodynamic effects may play important roles in the ecology of animals that inhabit understory kelp environments. We propose several potential effects of flow modification by kelps on larval recruitment and dispersal and growth of suspension-feeders. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {Model uncertainty and limited data are fundamental challenges to robust management of human intervention in a natural system. These challenges are acutely highlighted by concerns that many ecological systems may contain tipping points, such as Allee population sizes. Before a collapse, we do not know where the tipping points lie, if they exist at all. Hence, we know neither a complete model of the system dynamics nor do we have access to data in some large region of state-space where such a tipping point might exist. We illustrate how a Bayesian Non-Parametric (BNP) approach using a Gaussian Process (GP) prior provides a flexible representation of this inherent uncertainty. We embed GPs in a Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) framework in order to make robust management predictions with both model uncertainty and limited data. We use simulations to evaluate this approach as compared with the standard approach of using model selection to choose from a set of candidate models. We find that model selection erroneously favors models without tipping points -- leading to harvest policies that guarantee extinction. The GPDP performs nearly as well as the true model and significantly outperforms standard approaches. We illustrate this using examples of simulated single-species dynamics, where the standard model selection approach should be most effective, and find that it still fails to account for uncertainty appropriately and leads to population crashes, while management based on the GPDP does not, since it does not underestimate the uncertainty outside of the observed data.},

abstract = {In this paper we present results from dynamic simulations of the Northern California Current ecosystem, based on historical estimates of fishing mortality, relative fishing effort, and climate forcing. Climate can affect ecosystem productivity and dynamics both from the bottom-up (through short- and long-term variability in primary and secondary production) as well as from the top-down (through variability in the abundance and spatial distribution of key predators). We have explored how the simplistic application of climate forcing through both bottom-up and top-down mechanisms improves the fit of the model dynamics to observed population trends and reported catches for exploited components of the ecosystem. We find that using climate as either a bottom-up or a top-down forcing mechanism results in substantial improvements in model performance, such that much of the variability observed in single species models and dynamics can be replicated in a multi-species approach. Using multiple climate variables (both bottom-up and top-down) simultaneously did not provide significant improvement over a model with only one forcing. In general, results suggest that there do not appear to be strong trophic interactions among many of the longer-lived, slower-growing rockfish, roundfish and flatfish in this ecosystem, although strong interactions were observed in shrimp, salmon and small flatfish populations where high turnover and predation rates have been coupled with substantial changes in many predator populations over the last 40 years.},

We found no relationship between species richness and biomass under constant conditions. However, when communities were exposed to experimental drought, biomass increased with species richness. Responses of individual species demonstrated that facilitative interactions rather than sampling effects or niche complementarity best explained results-survivorship increased for almost all species, and those species least resistant to drought in monoculture had the greatest increase in biomass. Positive interactions may be an important but previously underemphasized mechanism linking high diversity to high productivity under stressful environmental conditions.},

abstract = {Understanding processes that drive sudden shifts in ecosystem structure and function has become an important research focus for coastal management. In kelp bed ecosystems, regime shifts occur when high densities of sea urchins destructively graze kelp and create coralline algal barrens. While the importance of predation and disease in mediating shifts between kelp beds and barrens on shallow rocky reefs has been well documented, little is known about the role of deep-living urchins in these alternative stable-state dynamics. In this study, we test the hypothesis that deep-living urchins along the central Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia move onshore and trigger shifts from kelp beds to barrens on shallow rocky reefs. We documented urchin distribution and abundance using tow-camera surveys down to 140 m depth and spanning 140 km of coast and created a predictive species-distribution model using these observations and spatial data on environmental factors that likely delineate suitable habitat for urchins. We used a random forest model to generate our predictions, which correctly classified 91{\%} of observations into a positive or negative occurrence of urchins. Sea urchins predominantly occurred within 1.5 km of shore, in depressions and flat habitats between 40 and 85 m depth. We found that shallow regions where destructive grazing fronts have been documented over the past four decades were closer to deep-living sea urchin habitats compared to regions that remained in a kelp bed state during the same period. This supports our prediction that deep-living urchins play an important role in driving shallow regime shift dynamics, and indicates that their distribution can help identify areas of coast that are most vulnerable to a collapse to barrens.},

abstract = {The loss or removal of individual species can cause dramatic changes in communities(1-5). Experiments indicate that in many communities only a few species will have such strong effects, whereas most will have weak effects owing to small per capita effects and/or low abundance(3,6-15,16). But extinction of these 'weak' interactors could significantly alter natural communities because they play important stabilizing or 'noise-dampening' roles(14,15,17-23). I demonstrate here that some 'weak' interactors may also be important by magnifying spatiotemporal variation in community structure. An analysis of published interaction strength data shows that the greatest variation in species effect occurred for the weakest interactions. A field experiment corroborates this and shows how indirect interactions can generate an inverse relationship between the mean and variance of a consumer's impact on its prey. When a species' effects are highly variable in sign and magnitude, they may average to seem weak over broad scales but be strong in local contexts. Thus, what is frequently considered to be 'noise' in species interaction data may be a critical part of the signal.},

abstract = {Coastal eutrophication has resulted in the reduced abundance of the perennial macroalga Fucus vesiculosus L. due to negative effects of increased turbidity, spatial competition, and grazing. We conducted a factorial field experiment to explore the main and interactive effects of three factors on the recruitment success of F. vesiculosus. We manipulated (1) substrate occupancy by offering unoccupied substrates and substrates occupied by a natural assembly of macroalgal spores, periphyton and loose material, (2) nutrient availability by exposing substrates to ambient and enriched nutrient conditions, and (3) herbivory by exclosing the natural herbivore community and enclosing either small (Hydrobia spp.) or large (Theodoxus fluviatilis L.) snails. Microrecruit density of F. vesiculosus depended on the density of parent algae in ambient nutrient availability, whereas, under enriched conditions, such dependency disappeared. Microrecruit density was lower on previously occupied than on unoccupied substrates and at enriched rather than ambient nutrient levels. The lowest recruitment success resulted from a combination of these two treatment levels. The microrecruit density of F. vesiculosus decreased sharply with the density of filamentous algae indicating that competition with opportunistic species contributed to poor recruitment success. Microrecruit density did not differ between the grazer exclosure and the natural grazer community treatment level reflecting locally low grazer densities and consequent weak grazing pressure in the study site. However, the enclosure of snails at higher densities that still naturally occur in the nearby areas affected the recruitment success of F. vesiculosus. This effect was dependent on nutrient availability; at ambient levels, snail grazers had only a minor negative effect on microrecruit density whereas under enriched conditions, both snail species negatively affected recruitment success. Thus, instead of reducing competition and thereby benefiting the perennial slow-growing F. vesiculosus, negative grazing effects by both snail species increased under nutrient-enriched conditions. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Changes in seasonal water availability had pronounced effects on individual species, but as precipitation regimes were sustained across years, feedbacks and species interactions overrode autecological responses to water and reversed community trajectories. Conditions that sharply increased production and diversity through 2 years caused simplification of the food web and deep reductions in consumer abundance after 5 years. Changes in these natural grassland communities suggest a prominent role for species interactions in ecosystem response to climate change. I},

We describe the application of MSE to investigate alternative strategies for achieving EBFM goals for a complex multispecies fishery in southeastern Australia. The study was undertaken as part of a stakeholder driven process to review and improve the ecological, economic and social performance of the fishery. An integrated management strategy, involving combinations of measures including quotas, gear controls and spatial management, performed best against a wide range of objectives and this strategy was subsequently adopted in the fishery, leading to marked improvements in performance. Although particular to one fishery, the conclusion that an integrated package of measures outperforms single focus measures we argue is likely to apply widely in fisheries that aim to achieve EBFM goals.},

abstract = {Shallow lakes, the most abundant lake type in the world, are very sensitive to climatic changes. The structure and functioning of shallow lakes are greatly impacted by submerged plants, and these may be affected by climate warming in various, contrasting, ways. Following a space-for-time substitution approach, we aimed to analyse the role of aquatic (submerged and free-floating) plants in shallow lakes under warm climates. We introduced artificial submerged and free-floating plant beds in five comparable lakes located in the temperate zone (Denmark, 55-57 degrees N) and in the subtropical zone (Uruguay, 30-35 degrees S), with the aim to study the structure and dynamics of the main associated communities. Regardless of differences in environmental variables, such as area, water transparency and nutrient status, we found consistent patterns in littoral community dynamics and structure (i.e. densities and composition of fish, zooplankton, macroinvertebrates, and periphyton) within, but substantial differences between, the two regions. Subtropical fish communities within the macrophyte beds exhibited higher diversity, higher density, smaller size, lower relative abundance of potentially piscivores, and a preference for submerged plants, compared with otherwise similar temperate lakes. By contrast, macroinvertebrates and cladocerans had higher taxon richness and densities, and periphyton higher biomass, in the temperate lakes. Several indicators suggest that the fish predation pressure was much stronger among the plants in the subtropical lakes. The antipredator behaviour of cladocerans also differed significantly between climate zones. Submerged and free-floating plants exerted different effects on the spatial distribution of the main communities, the effects differing between the climate zones. In the temperate lakes, submerged plants promoted trophic interactions with potentially positive cascading effects on water transparency, in contrast to the free-floating plants, and in strong contrast to the findings in the subtropical lakes. The higher impact of fish may result in higher sensitivity of warm lakes to external changes (e.g. increase in nutrient loading or water level changes). The current process of warming, particularly in temperate lakes, may entail an increased sensitivity to eutrophication, and a threat to the high diversity, clear water state.},

Individuals emerge from these after sunset and forage on organisms attached to the surrounding rock surface. Each urchin travels Pimelometopon pulchrum does not remove urchins from their shelters, but will attack and consume urchins placed in normal feeding locations during the daytime. The active periods of the sheephead and the urchin do not overlap; urchins begin foraging about 20 min after the diurnal sheephead retire in the evening and return to their shelters 1 to 2 h before sheephead resume feeding in the morning. We infer that the urchin's daytime crevice-dwelling and nocturnal foraging habits have evolved as a response to sheephead predation. Moreover, because shelters are limited in supply, shelter fidelity may have evolved to insure refuge from sheephead.},

abstract = {Snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) migrations in the eastern Bering Sea have long been ignored. Based on preliminary information, we hypothesized that females undergo an extensive ontogenetic migration, tracking down environmental gradients. We analyzed a 25-year time series of survey data and defined ontogenetic stages in terms of a “shell condition index” calibrated with radiochemical methods. “Pseudo-cohorts” of mature females (groups of females that undergo puberty molt in a given year) “recruit” to the mature female pool in the Middle Domain (50–100 m) of the intermediate shelf. Females undergo puberty molt and primiparous mating in winter. Over the next year, they mi- grate an average net distance of 73.5 nautical miles towards the shelf edge following a predominantly northeast– southwest direction. Maximum post-terminal molt life span is 6–7 years. Results support the hypothesis that the variable tracked is near-bottom temperature. Although near-bottom temperature fields vary from year to year, the corresponding vector field is a conservative template, which explains the consistency observed in the pattern of migration. Elucidation of the life history schedule of mature female snow crabs in the eastern Bering Sea revealed that it is very similar to that reported for eastern Canada, although patterns of migration may differ substantially between the two systems.},

The stock has not re-occupied its former wide distribution range, but remains concentrated in a limited area in the southern Baltic Sea. The biomass of forage fish, i.e., sprat and herring, is historic low in this area, which in combination with increasing cod stock results in locally high predation mortality of forage fish and cannibalism of cod. In line with low prey availability, body weight and nutritional condition of cod drastically declined. In the southern Baltic Sea, cod competes with pelagic fisheries for the limited resources of sprat and herring, while the largest biomass of these species is currently found outside the distribution range of cod. Accounting for spatial overlap between species is crucial in developing ecosystem based fisheries management to enhance the recovery of predator stocks. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {The 1997-98 El Nino was one of the strongest on record and resulted in widespread losses of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera (Agardh) along the west coast of North America. Drawing on a rich history of studies that have shown abnormally large waves and warm nutrient-poor water associated with El Ninos to negatively impact giant kelp populations at some locations in southern and Baja California, we examined (1) how these impacts scale up when considered across the species' geographic range in the NE Pacific Ocean and (2) if these impacts are generalizable over broad spatial scales. Working at 56 sites in 14 study locations over a 3 yr period (1997 to 2000), we examined how giant kelp populations were impacted by and recovered following the 1997-98 El Niho over a similar to 1500 km span along the west coast of North America. Our results indicate that while nearly all giant kelp disappeared from the southern one-third of the species' range along the coast of Baja California, Mexico, and heavy losses occurred throughout the central one-third of the species' range in southern California, USA, only minor impacts were observed throughout the northern one-third of the species' range in central California. Further, although highly variable among regions, these impacts were similar and generalizable among locations within each region. Our results also suggest that, as has been observed in local-scale studies, this large-scale variability in giant kelp mortality was driven by large-scale patterns in ocean temperature (nutrient concentration) and wave intensity. Recovery following El Niho, in contrast, was variable at multiple spatial scales and although not directly tested here, presumably influenced by numerous factors such as proximity to upwelling areas, competition with other algae, grazing, and propagule availability. Further, variability in the rates of recovery among locations resulted in a generally slow recovery of giant kelp throughout most of Baja California, and residual large-scale impacts of the El Niho were still evident 2 yr after the El Niho ended. As global climate change may lead to increases in the frequency and intensity of El Ninos, our findings have broad implications for the ways in which ecosystems might be expected to respond to them and provide a measure by which their impacts to giant kelp ecosystems may be compared among events.},

abstract = {To protect the main nursery area of plaice, an area called the 'Plaice Box' was closed to trawl fisheries with large vessels in 1989, with the expectation that recruitment, yield and spawning stock biomass would increase. However, since then the plaice population has declined and the rate of discarding outside the Plaice Box has increased, suggesting an offshore shift in spatial distribution of juvenile plaice. Using research vessel survey data collected since 1970, the change in distribution of juvenile age groups was analysed in relation to the distance to the coast. Further, a comparison of the distribution of different length classes of plaice between three historic periods was made (1902-1909; 1983-1987; 1999-2003). A shift towards deeper water of larger-sized plaice (20-39??cm) is apparent already before the 1980s and may be related to the decrease in the number of competitors or predators. An offshore shift in the distribution of young plaice occurred in the 1990s most likely in response to higher water temperatures that may have exceeded the maximum tolerance range or increased the food requirements above the available food resources. A decrease in competition with larger plaice offshore, possibly in combination with increased inshore predation by cormorants and seals, may also have played a role. The offshore shift in distribution has reduced the effectiveness of the Plaice Box as a technical measure to protect the under-sized plaice from discarding, since an increased proportion of the population of undersized plaice is moving to the more heavily exploited offshore areas. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we report the effects of increased CO2 concentration on the early development of the sea urchins Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus and Echinometra mathaei. We examined the fertilization, early cleavage, and pluteus larval stage to evaluate the impact of elevated CO2 concentration on fertilization rate, cleavage rate, developmental speed, and pluteus larval morphology. Furthermore, we compared the effects of CO2 and HCl at the same pH in an attempt to elucidate any differences between the two. We found that fertilization rate, cleavage rate, developmental speed, and pluteus larval size all tended to decrease with increasing CO2 concentration. Furthermore, CO2-seawater had a more severe effect than HCl-seawater on the fertilization rate. By contrast, the effects on cleavage rate, developmental speed, and pluteus larval morphology were similar for CO2- and HCl-seawater. Our results suggest that both decreased pH and altered carbonate chemistry affect the early development and life history of marine animals, implying that increased seawater CO2 concentration will seriously alter marine ecosystems. The effects of CO2 itself on marine organisms therefore requires further clarification.},

abstract = {One of the twenty-first century's greatest environmental challenges is to recover and restore species, habitats and ecosystems. The decision about how to initiate restoration is best-informed by an understanding of the linkages between ecosystem compo-nents and, given these linkages, an appreciation of the consequences of choosing to recover one ecosystem component before another. However, it remains difficult to predict how the sequence of species' recoveries within food webs influences the speed and trajectory of restoration, and what that means for human well-being. Here, we develop theory to consider the ecological and social implications of synchronous versus sequential (species-by-species) recovery in the context of exploited food webs. A dynamical systems model demonstrates that synchronous recovery of predators and prey is almost always more efficient than sequential recovery. Compared with sequential recovery, synchronous recovery can be twice as fast and produce transient fluctuations of much lower amplitude. A predator-first strategy is particularly slow because it counterproductively suppresses prey recovery. An analysis of real-world predator–prey recoveries shows that synchronous and sequential recoveries are similarly common, suggesting that current practices are not ideal. We highlight policy tools that can facilitate swift and steady recovery of ecosystem structure, function and associated services. T he unprecedented pace of change in the Anthropocene 1–3 has added urgency to the task of recovering degraded ecosystems, focusing attention on the time it takes to achieve conservation goals, restoration successes and social-ecological sustainability 4,5 . Restoration is a global priority of tremendous breadth, with recent international commitments to restore more than half a billion hectares of land 6 as well as the {\textgreater} 3,500 marine fisheries worldwide that remain overexploited 7 . The costliness of prolonged restoration efforts and mandates for rebuilding timelines make it all-the-more pressing to develop practical means to accelerate the speed of recov-eries 7–10 . Remarkably, the pace of recovery is often overlooked in ecosystem restoration. Here, we propose that the temporal sequence in which interventions are implemented can influence the pace of recovery, that this influence is often overlooked in ecosystem restoration, and that it is likely to play a critical role in shaping twenty-first century solutions to environmental issues. Conventionally, ecosystem restoration was underpinned by the idea that reinstating a plant community would provide habitat for associated animals. There is now increasing appreciation for the roles animals can play in facilitating restoration (for example, nutrient cycling) and the value of considering their dynamics from the outset to achieve desired ecosystem composition 10},

abstract = {Ocean currents are expected to be the predominant environmental factor influencing the dispersal of planktonic larvae or spores; yet, their characterization as predictors of marine connectivity has been hindered by a lack of understanding of how best to use oceanographic data. We used a high-resolution oceanographic model output and Lagrangian particle simulations to derive oceanographic distances (hereafter called transport times) between sites studied for Macrocystis pyrifera genetic differentiation. We build upon the classical isolation-by-distance regression model by asking how much additional variability in genetic differentiation is explained when adding transport time as predictor. We explored the extent to which gene flow is dependent upon seasonal changes in ocean circulation. Because oceanographic transport between two sites is inherently asymmetric, we also compare the explanatory power of models using the minimum or the mean transport times. Finally, we compare the direction of connectivity as estimated by the oceanographic model and genetic assignment tests. We show that the minimum transport time had higher explanatory power than the mean transport time, revealing the importance of considering asymmetry in ocean currents when modelling gene flow. Genetic assignment tests were much less effective in determining asymmetry in gene flow. Summer-derived transport times, in particular for the month of June, which had the strongest current speed, greatest asymmetry and highest spore production, resulted in the best-fit model explaining twice the variability in genetic differentiation relative to models that use geographic distance or habitat continuity. The best overall model also included habitat continuity and explained 65{\%} of the variation in genetic differentiation among sites.},

abstract = {The Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) modeling approach combines software for ecosystem trophic mass balance analysis (Ecopath), with a dynamic modeling capability (Ecosim) for exploring past and future impacts of fishing and environmental disturbances as well as for exploring optimal fishing policies. Ecosim models can be replicated over a spatial map grid (Ecospace) to allow exploration of policies such as marine protected areas, while accounting for spatial dispersal/advection effects. The Ecopath approach and software has been under development for two decades, with Ecosim emerging in 1995, and Ecospace in 1998, leading to an integrated and widely applied package. We present an overview of the computational aspects of the Ecopath, Ecosim and Ecospace modules as they are implemented in the most recent software version. The paper summarizes the capabilities of the modeling system with respect to evaluating how fisheries and the environment impact ecosystems. We conclude by a warning about pitfalls in the use of the software for policy exploration. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Forage fish generate economic benefits through directed fisheries, but also generate benefits through their role as prey to other valued species (large piscivorous fish, seabirds, and marine mammals). Previous evaluations of the ecosystem consequences of forage fish fisheries used mod-els with coarse taxonomic resolution of forage fish and their predators. Here, we quantify trade-offs between forage fish fisheries and predator fisheries, and between forage fish fisheries and species of conservation interest in the California Current, using a taxonomically detailed food-web model and a generalized equilibrium model. We propagated uncertainty in trade-offs to forage fish fishing based on uncertainty in food-web model parameterization and uncertainty in predator–prey functional relationships in the generalized equilibrium model. The model predicted loss in catch of some higher trophic level fisheries [mainly salmon (Oncorhynchus sp.) and halibut (Paralichthys californicus)] from fishing sardine (Sardinops sagax), anchovy (Engraulis mordax), herring (Clupea pallasii), or aggregated forage fish, but the lost economic reve-nue from predators never exceeded the economic benefit from additional forage fish catch. Predicted reductions in biomass of seabirds and marine mammals were sufficiently large that, depending on the value of these nonmarket species, consideration of nonmarket predators could tip the balance of trade-offs toward conservation of forage fish and away from harvest. This work highlights specific predators [brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis), marbled murrelets (Brachyramphus marmoratus), multiple other seabirds, sea lions (Zalophus californianus and Eumetopias jubatus), baleen whales (Mysticeti)] that are potentially sensitive to specific forage fish fisheries in the California Current.},

This paper reviews this philosophical dispute as it existed during the passage of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, and as it exists today in the implementation of that law, especially in relation with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (1976) provisions. Three case studies are presented: (1) the possible 'depleted' status designation for the northern fur seal, (2) the lack of lethal management options for curbing sea lions at the Ballard Locks fish ladder in Washington State, and (3) the problems associated with managing marine mammal and fisheries resource competition. The paper concludes by comparing marine mammal protection with the animal rights/anti-hunting movement onshore, and establishes an hypothetical scenario where protectionism continues to supercede the activities of fishermen. ?? 1989.},

A conspicuous pattern is alternating warm and cool periods of several years' duration. These variations in sea ice cover are reflected in the character of a subsurface cold pool, formed as stratification isolates the deeper cold waters from surface exchanges. The cold pool is better developed and more extensive in summers that follow deep southward penetration of winter sea ice. Interannual and decadal-scale variations in the distributions of some fish stocks reflect those of ice and thermal conditions. In particular, the distribution of walleye pollock, Theragra chalcogramma, varies significantly with multiannual cool and warm years while Arctic cod, Boreogadus saida, is only present within the cold pool. The relation among climate variations, sea ice cover, subsurface thermal conditions, and fish distribution provides information on how climate affects marine ecosystems and may also have practical application in predicting fish distributions.},

Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize 'best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In the period following wolf (Canis lupus) reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park (1995-2004), the northern Yellowstone elk (Cervus elaphus) herd declined from similar to 17000 to similar to 8000 elk (8.1{\%} yr(-1)). The extent to which wolf predation contributed to this decline is not obvious because the influence of other factors (human harvest and lower than average annual rainfall) on elk dynamics has not been quantified. To assess the contribution of wolf predation to this elk decline, we built and assessed models based on elk-related data prior to wolf reintroduction (1961 to 1995). We then used the best of these models to predict how elk dynamics might have been realized after wolf reintroduction (1995 to 2004) had wolves never been reintroduced. The best performing model predicted 64{\%} of the variance in growth rate and included elk abundance, harvest rate, annual snowfall, and annual precipitation as predictor variables. The best performing models also suggest that harvest may be super-additive. That is, for every one percent increase in harvest rate, elk population growth rate declines by more than one percent. Harvest rate also accounted for similar to 47{\%} of the observed variation in elk growth rate. According to the best-performing model, which accounts for harvest rate and climate, the elk population would have been expected to decline by 7.9{\%} per year, on average, between 1995 and 2004. Within the limits of uncertainty, which are not trivial, climate and harvest rate are justified explanations for most of the observed elk decline. To the extent that this is true, we suggest that between 1995 and 2004 wolf predation was primarily compensatory.},

Despite the ecological importance of sea urchins, direct field studies on the role that urchin predators play in shaping urchin populations are rare for southern Califor- nia. We conducted surveys and manipulative experiments within kelp forests near San Diego, CA, (32–51′28″N, 117–16′00″W) from 2006 to 2009 to determine whether predators such as sheephead (Semicossyphus pulcher) and spiny lobsters (Panulirus interruptus) may be linked to purple urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) and red urchin (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) distribution and habitat use, as well as purple urchin density-dependent mortality. Purple urchins were less dense and more cryptic inside a local marine protected area (MPA) that contained high predator abundance than in nearby heavily fished areas, whereas red urchins rarely were found outside the MPA. Urchin proportional mortality was inversely density dependent during the day when sheephead were active, despite fish aggregations in plots of high urchin density, but was density independent during the night when lob- sters were active. Urchin mortality was reduced under understory algal cover during the day, but not during the night. Examining whether urchin mortality from predation is density dependent and how habitat complexity influences this relationship is imperative because behavioral changes and increases in urchin populations can have vast ecologi- cal and economic consequences in kelp forest communities.},

abstract = {The linear equations that describe trophic fluxes in mass-balance, equilibrium assessments of ecosystems (such as in the ECOPATH approach) can be re-expressed as differential equations defining trophic interactions as dynamic relationships varying with biomasses and harvest regimes. Time patterns of biomass predicted by these differential equations, and equilibrium system responses under different exploitation regimes, are found by setting the differential equations equal to zero and solving for biomasses at different levels of fishing mortality. Incorporation of our approach as the ECOSIM routine into the well-documented ECOPATH software will enable a wide range of potential users to conduct fisheries policy analyses that explicitly account for ecosystem trophic interactions, without requiring the users to engage in complex modelling or information gathering much beyond that required for ECOPATH. While the ECOSIM predictions can be expected to fail under fishing regimes very different from those leading to the ECOPATH input data, ECOSIM will at least indicate likely directions of biomass change in various trophic groups under incremental experimental policies aimed at improving overall ecosystem management. That is, ECOSIM can be a valuable tool for design of ecosystem-scale adaptive management experiments.},

This study uses an ecosystem model of the North Sea to investigate questions relating to MSY in the context of mixed demersal fisheries for cod, haddock, and whiting. Results suggest that it is not possible to simultaneously achieve yields corresponding to MSYs predicted from single-species assessments and that the contradictory response of whiting is central to the trade-offs in yield and value for mixed demersal fisheries. Incompatibility between mixed-fishery and ecosystem-scale considerations exemplifies the difficult conceptual and practical challenges faced when moving toward an ecosystem approach.},

abstract = {The four general components of an ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) are reviewed. In taking account of environment forcing in stock dynamics, arguments are presented that effects of environmental forcing on growth, maturation and natural mortality are often more important to management than effects on recruitment. In holding fisheries accountable for the ecosystem effects of fishing, it is argued that direct effects of fishing are generally known and can be managed. However, interactions among fisheries and between fisheries and other sectors pose difficult challenges to equitable decisions in managing these impacts, and many traditional incentives function differently in EAF than in target-stock management. Achieving inclusiveness in decision-making and stewardship is also made more complex in EAF, because of the much larger number of interests with a legitimate role in decision-making. As a result, integrated management (IM) becomes a necessary component of EAF, although EAF and IM are not interchangeable concepts. The treatment of all four components of an EAF considers the need for a balanced and stable outcome on all three dimensions of sustainability – ecological, economic and social. It also highlights that different participant groups in governance display different risk tolerances for misses (not taking conservation action when needed) and false alarms (restraining access to social or economic benefits when little ecological benefit results). These differences in tolerances for different kinds of management errors often complicate decision-making an EAF setting and raise transaction costs greatly.},

It has been hypothesized that this was the result of a parent-offspring relation between sequentially linked strong cohorts of mature primiparous females, which requires that periodicity matches the time lapsed between egg extrusion by the maternal broodstock and the offspring reaching maturity. We show that female age at maturity (post-settlement) varies between 4.5 and 7.5 years, with most females maturing at 5.5-6.5 years (7-8 years after egg extrusion). Pulses of female recruitment to the mature population do not show a latitudinal trend, consistent with uniformity in age-at-maturity. Results of tracking crab abundance and size-frequency distributions in cod stomach and trawl samples between successive pulses of the cycle are consistent with the hypothesis of serial linkage among pulses. Periodicity is reflected in trends of clutch fullness and average shell condition and in the negative correlation between the strength of primiparous female cohorts and the mean size of their members.},

abstract = {This review discusses the interface between two of the most important types of interactions between species, interspecific competition and predation. Predation has been claimed to increase, decrease, or have little effect on, the strength, impact or importance of interspecific competition. There is confusion about both the meaning of these terms and the likelihood of, and conditions required for, each of these outcomes. In this article we distinguish among three measures of the influence of predation on competitive outcomes: short-term per capita consumption or growth rates, long-term changes in density, and the probability of competitive coexistence. We then outline various theoretical mechanisms that can lead to qualitatively distinct effects of predators. The qualitative effect of predators can depend both on the mechanism of competition and on the definition of competitive strength/impact. In assessing the empirical literature, we ask: (1) What definitions of competitive strength/impact have been assumed? (2) Does strong evidence exist to support one or more of the possible mechanisms that can produce a given outcome?

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Enhanced nutrient loading and depletion of consumer populations interact to alter the structure of aquatic plant communities. Nonetheless, variation between adjacent habitats in the relative strength of bottom-up (i.e. nutrients) versus top-down (i.e. grazing) forces as determinants of community structure across broad spatial scales remains unexplored. We experimentally assessed the importance of grazing pressure and nutrient availability on the development of macroalgal assemblages and the maintenance of unoccupied space in habitats differing in physical conditions (i.e. intertidal versus subtidal), across regions of contrasting productivity (oligotrophic coasts of South Australia versus the more productive coasts of Eastern Australia).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In Eastern Australia, grazers were effective in maintaining space free of macroalgae in both intertidal and subtidal habitats, irrespective of nutrient levels. Conversely, in South Australia, grazers could not prevent colonization of space by turf-forming macroalgae in subtidal habitats regardless of nutrients levels, yet in intertidal habitats removal of grazers reduced unoccupied space when nutrients were elevated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Assessing the effects of eutrophication in coastal waters requires balancing our understanding between local consumer pressure and background oceanographic conditions that affect productivity. This broader-based understanding may assist in reconciling disproportionately large local-scale variation, a characteristic of ecology, with regional scale processes that are often of greater relevance to policy making and tractability to management.},

However, individuals often remained within a small area for an extended period and then suddenly moved a much greater distance within a short time period. There were significant differences among age-sex classes, but not months, in the mean monthly distances between successive daily locations and between extreme locations of individual otters. There were significant differences among both age-sex classes and months in the harmonic mean distance deviation. For all three measures, juvenile males tended to move the greatest distances. Adult males tended to be more sedentary than adult females over the short term, but traveled over greater distances in the long term. Individuals within age-sex classes had different movement patterns, and individuals often had different movement patterns during the same month in successive years.

abstract = {Ecosystem dynamics are often complex, nonlinear, and characterized by critical thresholds or phase shifts. To implement sustainable management plans, resource managers need to accurately forecast species abundance. Moreover, an ecosystem-based approach to management requires forecasting the dynamics of all relevant species and the ability to anticipate indirect effects of management decisions. It is therefore crucial to determine which forecasting methods are most robust to observational and structural uncertainty. Here we describe a nonparametric method for multispecies forecasting and evaluate its performance relative to a suite of parametric models. We found that, in the presence of noise, it is often possible to obtain more accurate forecasts from the nonparametric method than from the model that was used to generate the data. The inclusion of data from additional species yielded a large improvement for the nonparametric model, a smaller improvement for the control model, and only a slight improvement for the alternative parametric models. These results suggest that flexible nonparametric modeling should be considered for ecosystem management.},

abstract = {The lesser sandeel, Ammodytes marinus, is a key food for many seabirds and seals, and is also the target of the largest single-species fishery in the North Sea. Despite claims that sandeel fishing has harmed dependent predator populations, census data show that most seabirds and grey seals increased in numbers as the fishery grew and reached peak harvest. Generally high breeding success of black-legged kittiwakes at North Sea colonies also suggests that sandeel abundance has remained good for breeding seabirds at the broad scale, though local and small-scale effects of sandeel fishing should not be overlooked. VPA and CPUE data suggest that abundance increased as the fishery grew. A negative correlation between sandeel recruitment and total stock size preceding spawning suggests that there is now resource competition (bottom-up control). Bioenergetics modelling indicates that predatory fish take far more sandeel than taken by the industrial fishery or wildlife. Effects of decreases in predatory fish stocks have been greater than increases in the take by seabirds and seals and by the fishery. Thus, overall, there appears to have been a reduction in mortality during the last 30 years. Changes in predatory fish abundances, especially mackerel and whiting, may influence sandeel stocks more than changes in industrial fishery, at least at the scale of the North Sea as a whole. These interactions imply that seabird and seal food supply in terms of sandeel may be strongly dependent on decisions regarding management of stocks of mackerel and gadoids. The overwhelming influence of predation on "food-fish" by predatory fish may be a feature of many marine food webs worldwide, where "fishing down the food web" has occurred, and this has clear management implications if wildlife and fisheries are to coexist.},

This IC gauges the inconsistency I between the nonlinear principal components (u and over(u, ̃)) for every data point x and its nearest neighbour over(x, ̃), with I = 1 - correlation (u, over(u, ̃)), where I tends to increase with overfitted solutions.

abstract = {Size-structured predator-prey interactions can be altered by the history of exploitation, if that exploitation is itself size-selective. For example, selective harvesting of larger sized predators can release prey populations in cases where only large individuals are capable of consuming a particular prey species. In this study, we examined how the history of exploitation and recovery (inside marine reserves and due to fisheries management) of California sheephead (Semicossyphus pulcher) has affected size-structured interactions with sea urchin prey in southern California. We show that fishing changes size structure by reducing sizes and alters life histories of sheephead, while management measures that lessen or remove fishing impacts (e.g. marine reserves, effort restrictions) reverse these effects and result in increases in density, size and biomass. We show that predation on sea urchins is size-dependent, such that the diet of larger sheephead is composed of more and larger sized urchins than the diet of smaller fish. These results have implications for kelp forest resilience, because urchins can overgraze kelp in the absence of top-down control. From surveys in a network of marine reserves, we report negative relationships between the abundance of sheephead and urchins and the abundance of urchins and fleshy macroalgae (including giant kelp), indicating the potential for cascading indirect positive effects of top predators on the abundance of primary producers. Management measures such as increased minimum size limits and marine reserves may serve to restore historical trophic roles of key predators and thereby enhance the resilience of marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {Plant community structure is often the result of interactions between succession, disturbance, and dispersal. While some disturbances may be highly stochastic (e.g., flooding or landslides), other types of disturbance are closely linked to the current successional state of the community (e.g., fire or herbivory). For example, when herbivores preferentially feed on early successional species they may generate conditions favorable for these species and thus create a positive feedback. Positive feedbacks may create multiple stable equilibria within plant communities. We demonstrate the presence of these positive feedbacks using experiments conducted in a restored California grassland. We found that pocket gophers () preferentially forage in areas dominated by annual species, and gopher foraging activity increases the abundance of annual plants. We use a Markov chain model to identify how the foraging behavior, dispersal behavior, and population dynamics of territorial herbivores can structure a plant community across multiple spatial scales. The model is loosely based on the biology of pocket gophers, though it is general enough to be applicable to other territorial herbivores with foraging preferences. We find that a foraging preference for early successional species can generate multiple plant communities that persist within a herbivore's territory. If juveniles are selective when searching for territories during their dispersal phase, then herbivores can also generate persistent and distinct plant communities over larger spatial scales. In this case, fixed regions of the landscape may become occupied by herbivores for long periods (many herbivore generations) and be composed of a range of successional plant species, whereas the remaining landscape is abandoned by herbivores and becomes dominated by late successional species. This structuring of the landscape occurs even though we assume that the entire landscape is intrinsically identical.},

abstract = {Fish populations are increasingly affected by multiple human and natural impacts including exploitation, eutrophication, habitat alteration and climate change. As a result many collapsed populations may have to recover in ecosystems whose structure and functioning differ from those in which they were formerly productive and supported sustainable fisheries. Here we investigate how a cod (Gadus morhua) population in the Baltic Sea whose biomass was reduced due to a combination of high exploitation and deteriorating environmental conditions might recover and develop in the 21st century in an ecosystem that likely will change due to both the already started recovery of a cod predator, the grey seal Halichoerus grypus, and projected climate impacts. Simulation modelling, assuming increased seal predation, fishing levels consistent with management plan targets and stable salinity, shows that the cod population could reach high levels well above the long-term average. Scenarios with similar seal and fishing levels but with 15{\%} lower salinity suggest that the Baltic will still be able to support a cod population which can sustain a fishery, but biomass and yields will be lower. At present knowledge of cod and seal interactions, seal predation was found to have much lower impact on cod recovery, compared to the effects of exploitation and salinity. These results suggest that dual management objectives (recovery of both seal and cod populations) are realistic but success in achieving these goals will also depend on how climate change affects cod recruitment.},

abstract = {Managing for simultaneous recovery of interacting species, particularly top predators and their prey, is a longstanding challenge in applied ecology and conservation. The effects of sea otters (Enhydra lutris kenyoni) on abalone (Haliotis spp.) is a salient example along North America's west coast where sea otters are recovering from 18th- and 19th-century fur trade while efforts are being made to recover abalone from more recent overfishing. To understand the direct and indirect effects of sea otters on northern abalone (H. kamtschatkana) and the relative influence of biotic and abiotic conditions, we surveyed subtidal rocky reef sites varying in otter occupation time in three regions of British Columbia, Canada. Sites occupied by sea otters for over 30 years had 16 times lower densities of exposed abalone than sites where otters have yet to recover (0.46 ± 0.08/20 m2 vs. 7.56 ± 0.98/20 m2), but they also had higher densities of cryptic abalone (2.17 ± 1.31/20 m2 vs. 1.31 ± 0.20/20 m2). Abalone densities were greater in deeper vs. shallower habitats at sites with sea otters compared to sites without otters. Sea otter effects on exposed abalone density were three times greater in magnitude than those of any other factor, whereas substrate and wave exposure effects on cryptic abalone were six times greater than those of sea otters. While higher substrate complexity may benefit abalone by providing refugia from sea otter predation, laboratory experiments revealed that it may also lead to higher capture efficiency by sunflower stars (Pycnopodia helianthoides), a ubiquitous mesopredator, compared to habitat with lower complexity. Sea otter recovery indirectly benefitted abalone by decreasing biomass of predatory sunflower stars and competitive grazing sea urchins, while increasing stipe density and depth of kelp that provides food and protective habitat. Importantly, abalone persisted in the face of sea otter recovery, albeit at lower densities of smaller and more cryptic individuals. We provide empirical evidence of how complex ecological interactions influence the effects of recovering predators on their recovering prey. This ecosystem-based understanding can inform conservation trade-offs when balancing multifaceted ecological, cultural, and socio-economic objectives for species at risk.},

abstract = {* Phenomenological density-feedback models estimate parameters such as carrying capacity (K) and maximum population growth rate (rm) from time series of abundances. However, most series represent fluctuations around K without extending to low abundances and are thus uninformative about rm. * We used informative prior distributions of maximum population growth rate, p(rm), to estimate Bayesian posterior distributions in Ricker and $\theta$-logistic models fitted to abundance series for 36 mammal species. We also used state-space models to account for observation errors. * We used two data sets of population growth rates from different mammal species with associated allometry (body mass) and demography (age at first reproduction) data to predict rm prior distributions. * We assessed patterns of differences in posterior means (r¯m) from models fitted with and without informative priors and used the deviance information criterion (DIC) to rank models for each species. * Differences in posterior r¯m from models with informative vs. vague priors co-varied with the prior mean (r{\^{}}m) for Ricker models, but only posterior $\theta$¯ co-varied with prior r{\^{}}m in $\theta$-logistic models. Informative-prior Ricker models ranked higher than (81{\%} of species), or equivalent to (all species), those with vague priors, which decreased to 70{\%} ranking higher for state-space models. Prior information also improved the precision of r¯m by 13–45{\%} depending on model and prior. * Posterior r¯m were highly sensitive to r{\^{}}m priors for $\theta$-logistic models (halving and doubling prior mean gave −56{\%} and 95{\%} changes in r¯m, respectively) and less sensitive for Ricker models (−25{\%} and 35{\%} changes in r¯m). * Our results show that fitting density-feedback models without prior information gives biologically unrealistic r¯m estimates in most cases, even from simple Ricker models. However, sensitivity analysis shows that high rm − $\theta$ correlation in $\theta$-logistic models means the fit is largely determined by the prior, precluding the use of this model for most census data. Our findings are supported by applying models to simulated time series of abundance. Prior knowledge of species' life history can provide more ecologically realistic estimates (matching theoretical predictions) of regulatory dynamics even in the absence of detailed demographic data, thereby potentially improving predictions of extinction risk.},

This is particularly problematic when ecological models are used to make conservation and management plans whose outcomes may depend strongly on model formulation. Nonlinear time series approaches allow us to circumvent this issue by using the observed dynamics of the system to guide policy development. However, these methods typically require long time series from stationary systems, which are rarely available in ecological settings. Here we present a Bayesian approach to nonlinear forecasting based on Gaussian processes that readily integrates information from several short time series and allows for nonstationary dynamics. We demonstrate the utility of our modeling methods on simulated from a wide range of ecological scenarios. We expect that these models will extend the range of ecological systems to which nonlinear forecasting methods can be usefully applied.},

abstract = {Techniques are needed to extend the generality of detailed experimental field studies. Multi-resolution sampling designs nest fine-scale sampling within information about broad-scale processes that may affect finer-scale data. These designs are very appropriate for studies seeking to detect the effects of processes operating over a variety of scales. We tested the utility of a novel, low-intensity/cost, multi-resolution sampling design in an investigation of the relationship between the suspension-feeding pinnid bivalve Atrina zelandica and surrounding benthic macrofauna. Interactions were modelled at different spatial scales, and a variety of covariates were included in the search for the best statistical and most sensible ecological model. We chose our sampling sites to encompass broad-scale gradients in A. zelandica density and size, depth, sediment characteristics and hydrodynamics. We found these gradients helped explain the relationship between A. zelandica and associated benthic macrofauna, Our results suggest that the strength of effects of A. zelandica on benthic macrofauna was dependent on 2 aspects of spatial scale: grain (the area over which A. zelandica measurements were made) and lag (the distance between where the A. zelandica and the macrofauna were sampled), By nesting fine-scale measures of benthic macrofaunal community composition within different spatial arrangements of individual A. zelandica, we were able to determine that the maximum distance between individual A, zelandica, rather than density estimates, better explained effects of A. zelandica on benthic macrofauna, This suggests the value of integrating broad-scale surveys with localised experiments so that organism interactions can be more generally interpreted on the basis of dynamics within landscapes rather than as density-to-density comparisons.},

abstract = {Similar to other species that in recent centuries experienced unregulated human exploitation, sea otters were extirpated throughout large portions of their historic range in the North Pacific. For most of the twentieth century, with cessation of the fur trade and because of concerted efforts at conservation, sea otters recovered much of their historic range and abundance. Late in the twentieth century, increased predation by killer whales in southwest Alaska drove sea otter populations to a few percentage points of their prior abundance, and one of the nation's largest oil spills in south-central Alaska caused the death of several thousand animals and required more than two decades for recovery. In California, entanglement in fishing gear and environmental degradation, among other factors, have contributed to slow growth in sea otter abundance. We discuss the role of density dependence and spatial structuring of populations in reduced rates of sea otter recovery recently detected in the Northeast Pacific, and consider the potential effects of multiple low-level and cumulative threats on sea otter populations. The resilience demonstrated by sea otters over the past century will be tested in upcoming decades as human activities continue to degrade nearshore coastal areas of the North Pacific.},

@article{Foster2010,
abstract = {It is increasingly argued that human-induced alterations to food webs have resulted in the degradation of coastal ecosystems and even their "collapse." We examined the evidence for this argument for Macrocystis pyrifera (giant kelp) forests in southern California. Others have concluded that forests in this region collapsed between 1950 and 1970 as a result of sea urchin grazing driven by overfishing of sea urchin predators (sheephead wrasse and spiny lobsters) and competitors (abalone), and that the kelp forests recovered but are currently sustained as a result of a commercial sea urchin fishery that began in the early 1970s. Our examination of the historical record, primary publications, and previously unpublished data showed that there was no widespread decline in the region between 1950 and 1970, but there were localised declines in mainland kelp forests near the rapidly growing cities of Los Angeles and San Diego. The preponderance of evidence indicates that kelp losses were caused primarily by large increases in contaminated sewage discharged into coastal waters, sedimentation from coastal development, and the 1957-1959 El Ni??o. Increases in active sea urchin foraging were most likely a secondary effect following dwindling food resources. The forests recovered when sewage treatment improved and sewage outfalls were relocated. The effects of fisheries were explored by correlation analysis between kelp canopy cover and commercial sea urchin landings, and among fisheries landings for sea urchins, abalone, sheephead and lobster. These correlations were generally insignificant, but were often confounded by differences in the spatial scale over which the data were collected as well as factors other than simple abundance that affect the fisheries. However, where area-specific data were available, the landings of sea urchins generally tracked kelp abundance, most likely because roe (gonad) development is directly related to food availability. A literature review showed that although sheephead and lobsters may control sea urchin abundance at small spatial scales within some sites, there is little evidence they do so over large areas. That abalone and sea urchins compete, such that sea urchins increased as a result of abalone harvesting, is largely conjecture based on their similar habitat and food utilization. This study shows that kelp forests in southern California did not collapse, and that declines in some coastal sites were caused primarily by degradation of water quality, increased sedimentation and contamination, and unfavorable oceanographic conditions. We conclude that management by species' protection or reserves will not be effective if poor habitat quality impacts the ability of giant kelp to survive and thrive. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Long-term in situ observations are widely used in a variety of climate analyses. Unfortunately, most decade- to century-scale time series of atmospheric data have been adversely impacted by inhomogeneities caused by, for example, changes in instrumentation, station moves, changes in the local environment such as urbanization, or the introduction of different observing practices like a new formula for calculating mean daily temperature or different observation times. If these inhomogeneities are not accounted for properly, the results of climate analyses using these data can be erroneous. Over the last decade, many climatologists have put a great deal of effort into developing techniques to identify inhomogeneities and adjust climatic time series to compensate for the biases produced by the inhomogeneities. It is important for users of homogeneity-adjusted data to understand how the data were adjusted and what impacts these adjustments are likely to make on their analyses. And it is important for developers of homogeneity-adjusted data sets to compare readily the different techniques most commonly used today. Therefore, this paper reviews the methods and techniques developed for homogeneity adjustments and describes many different approaches and philosophies involved in adjusting in situ climate data.},

abstract = {There is increasing interest in developing better predictive tools and a broader conceptual framework to guide the restoration of degraded land. Traditionally, restoration efforts have focused on re-establishing historical disturbance regimes or abiotic conditions, relying on successional processes to guide the recovery of biotic communities. However, strong feedbacks between biotic factors and the physical environment can alter the efficacy of these successional-based management efforts. Recent experimental work indicates that some degraded systems are resilient to traditional restoration efforts owing to constraints such as changes in landscape connectivity and organization, loss of native species pools, shifts in species dominance, trophic interactions and/or invasion by exotics, and concomitant effects on biogeochemical processes. Models of alternative ecosystem states that incorporate system thresholds and feedbacks are now being applied to the dynamics of recovery in degraded systems and are suggesting ways in which restoration can identify, prioritize and address these constraints.},

abstract = {This paper studies the effect of the reduction in the trawling effort of large beam trawlers ({\textgreater}300 hp) in the coastal waters of the south-eastern North Sea following the establishment in 1989 of a protected area, the ‘‘plaice box'', using data from annual beam trawl surveys carried out since 1985. Two different aspects of the demersal fish assemblage were analysed: (1) the size distribution using multiple analysis of variance; and (2) the species composition using multivariate techniques such as principal component analysis, multidimensional scaling and multiple analysis of variance. It is shown that the overall size structure of the commercially exploited fish species was affected by the change in trawling effort whereas that of the non-target species was not. In particular, the abundance of commercial fish within the marketable size-range of 25–40 cm increased when fishing effort was reduced. Multiple analysis of variance showed that, in contrast to the size structure of the fish assemblage, the species composition was not significantly affected by the change in fishing effort. However principal component analysis does indicate that after the closure of the ‘‘plaice box'' a considerable proportion of the variation in the abundance of the large fish (25 cm) over the years can be explained by a higher abundance in the ‘‘box'' area than in the reference area of most fish species, including the two main commercial species plaice and sole. Other trends that were observed during the study period both within and outside the closed area were: (1) a decrease of the relative abundance of plaice and (2) a general increase of species richness due to the influx of southerly species.},

abstract = {Because sea otters (Enhydra lutris) exert a wide array of direct and indirect effects on coastal marine ecosystems throughout their geographic range, we investigated the potential influence of sea otters on the ecology of Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) in the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, USA. We studied the diets, productivity, and density of breeding Bald Eagles on four islands during 1993-1994 and 2000-2002, when sea otters were abundant and scarce, respectively. Bald Eagles depend on nearshore marine communities for most of their prey in this ecosystem, so we predicted that the recent decline in otter populations would have an indirect negative effect on diets and demography of Bald Eagles. Contrary to our predictions, we found no effects on density of breeding pairs on four islands from 1993-1994 to 2000-2002. In contrast, diets and diet diversity of Bald Eagles changed considerably between the two time periods, likely reflecting a change in prey availability resulting from the increase and subsequent decline in sea otter populations. The frequency of sea otter pups, rock greenling (Hexagammus lagocephalus), and smooth lumpsuckers (Aptocyclus ventricosus) in the eagle's diet declined with corresponding increases in Rock Ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus), Glaucous-winged Gulls (Larus glaucescens), Atka mackerel (Pleurogrammus monopterygius), and various species of seabirds during the period of the recent otter population decline. Breeding success and productivity of Bald Eagles also increased during this time period, which may be due to the higher nutritional quality of avian prey consumed in later years. Our results provide further evidence of the wide-ranging indirect effects of sea otter predation on nearshore marine communities and another apex predator, the Bald Eagle. Although the indirect effects of sea otters are widely known, this example is unique because the food-web pathway transcended five species and several trophic levels in linking one apex predator to another.},

Here we synthesized 171 studies that manipulated two or more stressors in marine and coastal systems and found that cumulative effects in individual studies were additive (26{\%}), synergistic (36{\%}), and antagonistic (38{\%}). The overall interaction effect across all studies was synergistic, but interaction type varied by response level (community: antagonistic, population: synergistic), trophic level (autotrophs: antagonistic, heterotrophs: synergistic), and specific stressor pair (seven pairs additive, three pairs each synergistic and antagonistic). Addition of a third stressor changed interaction effects significantly in two-thirds of all cases and doubled the number of synergistic interactions. Given that most studies were performed in laboratories where stressor effects can be carefully isolated, these three-stressor results suggest that synergies may be quite common in nature where more than two stressors almost always coexist. While significant gaps exist in multiple stressor research, our results suggest an immediate need to account for stressor interactions in ecological studies and conservation planning.},

We analysed 6 years of catch data for 0-group Pacific cod in fishery-independent surveys of the Bering Sea shelf. Juvenile cod were most commonly captured on the middle shelf over depths of 50–80 m and were rarely captured north of 588N. Consistently high catches were observed east of the Pribilof Islands and north of Port Moller along the Alaska Peninsula. There was evidence of density-dependent habitat selection at the local scale as the frequency of occurrence increased with regional catch per unit effort. At the basin scale, the southerly distribution of the weak 2009 cohort suggested the possibility of a range contraction for small cohorts. There was no consistent shift in the distribution of juvenile Pacific cod in response to interannual climate variability. These results for Pacific cod contrast with those observed for walleye pollock, which appears to exhibit greater variance in distribution, but are similar to patterns observed for juvenile Atlantic cod. Future work should focus on distribution in nearshore habitats and examine the patterns of dispersal and the connectivity of the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska populations.},

abstract = {Regular observations made over a period of 5 yr in four permanent transects provided data on plant, sea urchin, and fish densities which indicate that two unusually severe winter storms in 1980 ("Storm I") and 1983 ("Storm II") had different effects on a southern California kelp-forest community. Storm I removed all canopies of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, but spared most understory kelps, mainly Pterygophora californica. Hence, the previously large accumulation of detached drift kelp, mostly M. pyrifera, disappeared. Denied their preferred diet of drift kelp, the sea urchins Strongylocentrotusfranciscanus and S.purpuratus then emerged from shelters to find alternative food. Without effective predators, they con- sumed most living plants, including the surviving under- story kelps. This weakened the important detritus-based food chain, as indicated indirectly by declining abundances of algal turf and fish (Embiotocidae) that eat small animals living in turf. In 1983, Storm II reversed the process by eliminating exposed urchins, while clearing rock surfaces for widespread kelp settlement and growth. By summer 1984, the kelp grew to maturity to form extensive canopies despite elevated water temperatures during summer and fall of 1983. Thus, severe storms may have vastly different effects on community structure, depending on the state of the community before the disturbance. Introduction},

abstract = {Defining and attaining suitable management goals probably represent the most difficult part of ecosystem-based fisheries management. To achieve those goals we ultimately need to define ecosystem overfishing in a way that is analogous to the concept used in single-species management. Ecosystem-based control rules can then be formulated when various ecosystem indicators are evaluated with respect to fishing-induced changes. However, these multi-attribute control rules will be less straightforward than those applied typically in single-species management, and may represent a gradient rather than binary decision criteria. Some ecosystem-based decision criteria are suggested, based on indicators empirically derived from the Georges Bank, Gulf of Maine ecosystem. Further development in the translation of ecosystem indicators into decision criteria is one of the major areas for progress in fisheries science and management.},

abstract = {Recent studies suggest that nearshore oceanographic conditions can have important effects on the structure of benthic communities. On Santa Cruz Island (SCI), CA, USA there is a persistent difference in mean annual sea surface temperature (SST) around the island due to its location at the confluence of opposing cold and warm ocean current systems. Over the course of a 4-year study (1997–2001) seawater nutrient and chl-a concentrations, algal tissue C:N ratios, recruitment and growth of filter-feeders (barnacles and mussels), and intertidal community structure were measured at six intertidal sites around the island. There were strong associations between remotely sensed SST and patterns of community structure. Macrophyte abundance was highest at sites with persistently low SST, while recruitment, abundance, and growth of filter-feeding invertebrates were strongly, positively correlated with SST. The cold-water sites were associated with higher nutrient concentrations and lower algal C:N ratios, particularly in the winter months. Values of chl-a were generally low and variable among sites, and were not correlated with the predominant SST gradient. Recruitment of barnacles and mussels was positively correlated with adult abundance across all sites. While detailed experimental studies are needed to further evaluate the mechanisms underlying community dynamics, these results indicate that the confluence of cold- and warm-water masses around SCI may determine the contrasting patterns of intertidal community structure.},

abstract = {Landings of the snow crab Chionoecetes opilio (J. C. Fabricius, 1788), which supports a lucrative fishery in the eastern Bering Sea (EBS), dropped to historical lows by 2000, and the geographic range of reproductive females contracted to the northwest. Resilience of the mature female range through larval advection may be hampered because hatching now occurs downstream. These changes have been punctuated by four pulses of recruitment, with a remarkably regular period of 6-7 yrs. Major pulses of the fishery, during the 1990s, were sustained by recruitment pulses that originated in regions of the northwest section of the EBS shelf beyond the reach of the fishery. Here we present, for the first time, a conceptual model of snow-crab spatial dynamics that integrates empirical information with new results from modeling of circulation and larval transport. The geographic region of interest, defined by means of biophysical modeling and tracking ontogenetic migrations, consists of the middle and outer domains of the EBS shelf, bounded by the 50- and 200-m isobaths. Connectivity analysis highlights the significance of subsystems in the southeast and northwest sections of the EBS's middle domain. Predicted settlement regions match historical regions of abundance of immature crabs and are consistent with observed fields of suitable near-bottom temperature. Our study, together with others, highlights the significance of climate change for the fate of important high-latitude fisheries.},

We conducted an aerial survey of the Aleutian archipelago in 2000 and compared results with similar surveys conducted in 1965 and 1992. The number of sea otters counted decreased by 75{\%} between 1965 and 2000; 88{\%} for islands at equilibrial density in 1965. The population decline likely began in the mid-1980s and declined at a rate of 17.5{\%}/year in the 1990s. The minimal population estimate was 8,742 sea otters in 2000. The population declined to a uniformly low density in the archipelago, suggesting a common and geographically widespread cause. These data are in general agreement with the hypothesis of increased predation on sea otters. These data chronicle one of the most widespread and precipitous population declines for a mam-malian carnivore in recorded history.},

abstract = {Marine ecosystems can experience regime shifts, in which they shift from being organized around one set of mutually reinforcing structures and processes to another. Anthropogenic global change has broadly increased a wide variety of processes that can drive regime shifts. To assess the vulnerability of marine ecosystems to such shifts and their potential consequences, we reviewed the scientific literature for 13 types of marine regime shifts and used networks to conduct an analysis of co-occurrence of drivers and ecosystem service impacts. We found that regime shifts are caused by multiple drivers and have multiple consequences that co-occur in a non-random pattern. Drivers related to food production, climate change and coastal development are the most common co-occurring causes of regime shifts, while cultural services, biodiversity and primary production are the most common cluster of ecosystem services affected. These clusters prioritize sets of drivers for management and highlight the need for coordinated actions across multiple drivers and scales to reduce the risk of marine regime shifts. Managerial strategies are likely to fail if they only address well-understood or data-rich variables, and international cooperation and polycentric institutions will be critical to implement and coordinate action across the scales at which different drivers operate. By better understanding these underlying patterns, we hope to inform the development of managerial strategies to reduce the risk of high-impact marine regime shifts, especially for areas of the world where data are not available or monitoring programmes are not in place.},

abstract = {Positive and negative interactions among organisms are key determinants of pattern in the distribution and abundance of many species. Beneath subtidal canopies of kelp Ecklonia radiata (Laminariales), we observed sparse covers of erect algae (articulated coralline algae and filamentous turf-forming algae) that formed extensive covers where canopies were absent. Moreover, articulated corallines occurred in greater abundance beneath canopies of E. radiata mixed with canopy-forming species of Fucales than beneath monospecific canopies of E. radiata. We experimentally tested the hypotheses that (1) canopies negatively affect the abundance of articulated corallines and filamentous turfs, (2) physical abrasion of the substratum by canopies contributes to such negative effects, and (3) the effect of abrasion on articulated corallines is greater beneath monospecific canopies than mixed-species canopies, but the effect on filamentous turfs does not differ between types of canopy. Experiments revealed large negative effects of canopies on the abundance of articulated corallines and filamentous turfs, to which abrasion made a substantial contribution ({\~{}}54 to 67{\%} for articulated coralline and {\~{}}58{\%} for filamentous turf). Moreover, the intensity of abrasion was greater beneath monospecific than mixed-species canopies, which was consistent with differences in the effect of canopies and abrasion on articulated corallines (monospecific {\textgreater} mixed-species) but not filamentous turfs (monospecific = mixed-species). Although abrasion is one of many possible influences of algal canopies, our results show that it can substantially contribute to the heterogeneity of understorey habitat on subtidal rocky coasts. Comparison with prior research suggests that the effects of E. radiata canopies on understorey algae may be largely explained by the combined effects of shade, sedimentation and abrasion.},

abstract = {We constructed a size- and trait-based dynamic marine community model of the Celtic Sea/Biologically Sensitive Area, including grey seals Halichoerus grypus (Fabricius 1791) and harbour seals Phoca vitulina vitulina (Linnaeus 1758) to examine potential resource conflict between seals and commercial trawl fisheries. The model incorporates seal diet preference, population size and commercial fishery catch, with survey data to quantify ecological interactions between seals and fisheries. Total annual consumption by seals was an order of magnitude less than the catch of the modelled trawl fishery. Increasing fishing pressure reduced fish spawning stock biomass (SSB) much more than a proportionally equivalent increase in seal predation. For most fish species, quadrupling seal predation showed little effect on the predicted fishery catch. These results arise from relatively low seal abundance and partial niche partitioning. The fishery harvested a wider range of fish lengths and species than seals consumed. The fish community was dominated by small fish lengths and seals predated on these more than suggested by their calculated diet preference. Seal predation disproportionately affected several fish species not targeted by the fishery, but seal predation did not significantly affect the SSB of any of the species that constitute 90{\%} of the total landings of the fishery.Synthesis and applications. Predation of fish by grey and harbour seals is unlikely to harm commercial trawl fisheries in south-west Irish waters. This conclusion differs from those of some model-based studies of other North Atlantic systems, demonstrating the need for ecosystem-specific evidence in considering such conflicts. In systems with low niche overlap between seals and fisheries, the two are largely decoupled in effect, leaving fishing pressure as the overwhelming determinant of targeted fish stock status.},

abstract = {Mixed fisheries are the dominant type of fishery worldwide. Overexploitation in mixed fisheries occurs when catches continue for available quota species while low quota species are discarded. As EU fisheries management moves to count all fish caught against quota (the “landing obligation”), the challenge is to catch available quota within new constraints, else lose productivity. A mechanism for decoupling exploitation of species caught together is spatial targeting, which remains challenging due to complex fishery and population dynamics. How far spatial targeting can go to practically separate species is often unknown and anecdotal. We develop a dimension-reduction framework based on joint dynamic species distribution modelling to understand how spatial community and fishery dynamics interact to determine species and size composition. In application to the highly mixed fisheries of the Celtic Sea, clear common spatial patterns emerge for three distinct assemblages. While distribution varies interannually, the same species are consistently found in higher densities together, with more subtle differences within assemblages, where spatial separation may not be practically possible. We highlight the importance of dimension reduction techniques to focus management discussion on axes of maximal separation and identify spatiotemporal modelling as a scientific necessity to address the challenges of managing mixed fisheries.},

abstract = {In the domain of decision-support tools for the management of marine fish resources, considerable attention has been paid to the development of models explaining how fish stocks change over space and time. In most models, fishing effort is assumed to be exogenous and determined by factors such as management. Increasingly, there has been a call for bio-economic models to also account for the dynamics of fishing fleets, recognizing that fishers respond to changing environmental, institutional and economic conditions. A growing literature has sought to explicitly model the endogenous determinants of the capacity of fishing fleets, the intensity of its use and its temporal and spatial allocation across fishing opportunities. We review this literature, focusing on empirical applications of the behavioural models that have been put forward to explain and predict observed fleet dynamics. We find that although economic factors are usually included as a dominant driver in most studies, this is often based on the use of proxy variables for the key economic drivers, for which adequate data are lacking. Also, while many studies acknowledge that social and socialpsychological factors play a significant role in explaining observed fishing behaviour, their inclusion in fishing fleet dynamic models is still very limited. Progress in this domain can only be achieved via the development of multidisciplinary research programmes focusing on applied quantitative analysis of the drivers of fishing fleet dynamics.},

Because sea otters are now extinct from much of this region and have not fully recolonized their former range (e.g. Haida Gwaii and most of northern BC) these data represent an important first step towards better understanding sea otter foraging ecology in BC. The isotopic data suggest a diet composed primarily of benthic invertebrates, with a very low reliance on epibenthic fish. There is very low isotopic and thus inter-individual dietary variability in Holocene BC sea otters during the late Holocene. Furthermore, zooarchaeological abundance data suggest that otters represented a widespread and significant focus of aboriginal hunting practices on the northern BC coast during the mid- to late-Holocene. The consistent reliance on a small number of low-trophic level prey and limited dietary variability in Holocene BC sea otters may reflect top-down impacts on otter populations by aboriginal peoples. As part of our assessment of sea otter diet, we review trophic discrimination factors ($\Delta$ 13C and $\Delta$ 15N) for bone collagen from published literature and find marked variability, with mean values of +3.7 ± 1.6 for $\Delta$ 13C (n = 21) and +3.6 ± 1.3 for $\Delta$ 15N (n = 15). {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Predation is the largest source of mortality for marine fish and may be an important process in regulating population size. Recent population models have attempted to quantify predation separately from other sources of natural mortality. Building upon such work, a multispecies age-structured assessment model (MSASA) for the Gulf of Alaska was developed, which included arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), and walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma). Predation mortality was a flexible function of predator and prey abundances that was fitted to stomach-content data. A proof of concept illustration is presented here, assessing model outputs against a set of single-species models. The MSASA model was able to successfully estimate predation between species and integrate it into total mortality. Significant predation occurred on younger pollock and flounder. Results indicate a significant change in predation over time on pollock as a function of increased arrowtooth flounder abundance. Estimating mortality and other parameters for three species simultaneously is complex, and the advantage of greater biological realism of MSASA comes at the expense of greater uncertainty in parameter estimation.},

abstract = {Striking differences in the dispersal of coexisting species have fascinated marine ecologists for decades. Despite widespread attention to the impact of dispersal on individual species dynamics, its role in species interactions has received comparatively little attention. Here, we approach the issue by combining analyses of simple heuristic predator-prey models with different dispersal patterns and data from several predator-prey systems from the Pacific coasts of North and South America. In agreement with model predictions, differences in predator dispersal generated characteristic biogeographic patterns. Predators lacking pelagic larvae tracked geographic variation in prey recruitment but not prey abundance. Prey recruitment rate alone explained more than 80{\%} of the biogeographic variation in predator abundance. In contrast, predators with broadcasting larvae were uncorrelated with prey recruitment or adult prey abundance. Our findings reconcile perplexing results from previous studies and suggest that simple models can capture some of the complexity of life-history diversity in marine communities.},

abstract = {Primary producers rarely exist under their ideal conditions, with key processes often limited by resource availability. As human activities modify environmental conditions, and therefore resource availability, some species may be released from these limitations while others are not, potentially disrupting community structure. In order to examine the limitations experienced by algal functional groups that characterise alternate community structures (i.e. turf-forming algae and canopy-forming kelp), we exposed these groups to contemporary and enriched levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nutrients. Turfs responded to the individual enrichment of both CO2 and nutrients, with the greatest shift in the biomass and carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratios observed under their combined enrichment. In contrast, kelp responded to enriched nutrients, but not enriched CO2. We hypothesise that the differing limitations reflect the contrasting physiologies of these functional groups, specifically their methods of C acquisition, such as the possession and/or efficiency of a carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM). Importantly, our results reveal that these functional groups, whose interactions structure entire communities, experience distinct resource limitations, with some potentially limited by a single type of resource (i.e. kelp by nutrients), while others may be co-limited (i.e. turf by CO2 and nutrients). Consequently, the identification of how alternate conditions modify resource availability and limitations may facilitate anticipation of the future sustainability of major ecosystem components and the communities they support.},

abstract = {The stock of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) on the eastern Scotian Shelf (ESS) collapsed in the early 1990s and showed no sign of recovery during a 15-year fishing moratorium, but has recently increased in abundance. Both the pro- longed lack of recovery and the recent improvement have been attributed to changes in the biomass of forage fishes through effects of predation and competition by these fishes on early life stages of cod. An examination of the relationships between forage fish biomass and the population dynamics of ESS cod provided no support for this hypothesis. Contrary to expecta- tions under this hypothesis, cod recruitment rate was unrelated to forage fish biomass. The main factor delaying recovery was high natural mortality (M) of adult cod. The recent improvement in ESS cod is due to the strong 2004 year class and a decline in M. These factors cannot be attributed to an effect of forage fishes. Both the delay in recovery and recent improve- ment of the ESS cod stock appear to be due to factors other than interactions with forage fishes.},

abstract = {Coral reef bleaching, the temporary or permanent loss of photosynthetic microalgae (zooxanthellae) and/or their pigments by a variety of reef taxa, is a stress response usually associated with anthropogenic and natural disturbances. Degrees of bleaching, within and among coral colonies and across reef communities, are highly variable and difficult to quantify, thus complicating comparisons of different bleaching events. Small-scale bleaching events can often be correlated with specific disturbances (e.g. extreme low/high temperatures, low/high solar irradiance, subaerial exposure, sedimentation, freshwater dilution, contaminants, and diseases), whereas large scale (mass) bleaching occurs over 100s to 1000s of km2, which is more difficult to explain. Debilitating effects of bleaching include reduced/no skeletal growth and reproductive activity, and a lowered capacity to shed sediments, resist invasion of competing species and diseases. Severe and prolonged bleaching can cause partial to total colony death, resulting in diminished reef growth, the transformation of reef-building communities to alternate, non-reef building community types, bioerosion and ultimately the disappearance of reef structures. Present evidence suggests that the leading factors responsible for large-scale coral reef bleaching are elevated sea temperatures and high solar irradiance (especially ultraviolet wavelengths), which may frequently act jointly.},

abstract = {Ecological theory suggests that large-scale patterns such as community stability can be influenced by changes in interspecific interactions that arise from the behavioural and/or physiological responses of individual species varying over time. Although this theory has experimental support, evidence from natural ecosystems is lacking owing to the challenges of tracking rapid changes in interspecific interactions (known to occur on timescales much shorter than a generation time) and then identifying the effect of such changes on large-scale community dynamics. Here, using tools for analysing nonlinear time series and a 12-year-long dataset of fortnightly collected observations on a natural marine fish community in Maizuru Bay, Japan, we show that short-term changes in interaction networks influence overall community dynamics. Among the 15 dominant species, we identify 14 interspecific interactions to construct a dynamic interaction network. We show that the strengths, and even types, of interactions change with time; we also develop a time-varying stability measure based on local Lyapunov stability for attractor dynamics in non-equilibrium nonlinear systems. We use this dynamic stability measure to examine the link between the time-varying interaction network and community stability. We find seasonal patterns in dynamic stability for this fish community that broadly support expectations of current ecological theory. Specifically, the dominance of weak interactions and higher species diversity during summer months are associated with higher dynamic stability and smaller population fluctuations. We suggest that interspecific interactions, community network structure and community stability are dynamic properties, and that linking fluctuating interaction networks to community-level dynamic properties is key to understanding the maintenance of ecological communities in nature.},

The model incorporates stock structure, seasonal migration, predation, Allee effects, and variation in natural mortality. The simulated dynamics of two substocks were compared under three management options: (1) historical catch levels; (2) combined management (substocks are managed as one unit) with a constant fishing mortality rate (F) of 0.4; and (3) separated management (substocks are managed individually) with the same F level. Three major conclusions emerged from the simulations. First, the population dynamics under historical catch levels tended to vary widely from complete extinction to a fourfold increase. Second, constant-F management produced stable population dynamics, reduced the probability of stock decline, and yielded a higher average catch. Third, the combined management option resulted in overfishing the more vulnerable substock; separated management helped to prevent the more vulnerable substock from collapse, but its performance was compromised when there was net immigration to the more vulnerable substock.},

abstract = {We investigated spatial patterns of synchrony among coral reef fish populations and environmental variables over an eight-year period on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Our aims were to determine the spatial scale of intra- and interspecific synchrony of fluctuations in abundance of nine damselfish species (genus Pomacentrus) and assess whether environmental factors could have influenced population synchrony. All species showed intraspecific synchrony among populations on reefs separated by {\textless} or =100 km, and interspecific synchrony was also common at this scale. At greater spatial scales, only four species showed intraspecific synchrony, over distances ranging from 100-300 km to 500-800 km, and no cases of interspecific synchrony were recorded. The two mechanisms most likely to cause population synchrony are dispersal and environmental forcing through regionally correlated climate (the Moran effect). Dispersal may have influenced population synchrony over distances up to 100 km as this is the expected spatial range for ecologically significant reef fish dispersal. Environmental factors are also likely to have synchronized population fluctuations via the Moran effect for three reasons: (1) dispersal could not have caused interspecific synchrony that was common over distances {\textless} or =100 km because dispersal cannot link populations of different species, (2) variations in both sea surface temperature and wind speed were synchronized over greater spatial scales ({\textgreater}800 km) than fluctuations in damselfish abundance ({\textless} or =800 km) and were correlated with an index of global climate variability, the El Ni{\{}{\~{n}}{\}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and (3) synchronous population fluctuations of most damselfish species were correlated with ENSO; large population increases often followed ENSO events. We recorded regional variations in the strength of population synchrony that we suspect are due to spatial differences in geophysical, oceanographic, and population characteristics, which act to dilute or enhance the effects of synchronizing mechanisms. We conclude that synchrony is common among Pomacentrus populations separated by tens of kilometers but less prevalent at greater spatial scales, and that environmental variation linked to global climate is likely to be a driving force behind damselfish population synchrony at all spatial scales on the Great Barrier Reef.},

To this aim, predators have been employed in conservation as keystone, um- brella, sentinel, flagship, and indicator species. However, quantitative tests of their surrogate-efficacy have been astonishingly few. Evidence suggests they may function as structuring agents and biodiversity indicators in some ecosystems but not others, and that they perform poorly as umbrella species; more consensus exists for their efficacy as sentinel and flagship species.

abstract = {We use data from San Miguel Island shell middens spanning much of the past 10,000 years in a preliminary exploration of long-term ecological relationships between humans, sea otters (Enhydra lutris), shellfish, and kelp forests. At Daisy Cave, human use of marine habitats begins almost 11,500 years ago, with the earliest evidence for shellfish harvesting (11,500 cal BP), intensive kelp bed fishing (ca. 10,000-8500 cal BP), and Sea Otter hunting (ca. 8900 cal BP) from the Pacific Coast of North America. On San Miguel Island, Native Americans appear to have coexisted with sea otters and productive shellfish populations for over 9,000 years, but the emphasis of shellfish harvesting changed over time. Knowledge of modern sea otter behavior and ecology suggests that shell middens dominated by large red abalone shells—relatively common on San Miguel between about 7,300 and 3,300 years ago—are only likely to have formed in areas where sea otter populations had been reduced by Native hunting or other causes. Preliminary analysis of sea urchin lenses, in which the remains of urchins are unusually abundant, may also signal an increasing impact of Island Chumash populations on kelp forest and other near shore habitats during the late Holocene. Such impacts were probably relatively limited, however, when compared to the rapid and severe disruption caused by commercial exploitation under the Spanish, Mexican, and American regimes of historic times.},

The patterns of density-dependent resource competition and the mechanisms leading to competitive exclusion in an experimental two-species insect age-structured interaction were investigated. 2. The modes of competition (scramble or contest) and strength of competition (under- to overcompensatory) operating within and between the stages of the two species was found to be influenced by total competitor density, the age structure of the competitor community and whether competition is between stages of single or two species. 3. The effect of imposed resource limitation on survival was found to be asymmetric between stages and species. Environments supporting both dominant and subordinate competitors were found to increase survival of subordinate competitors at lower total competitor densities. Competitive environments during development within individual stage cohorts (i.e. small or large larvae), differed from the competitive environment in lumped age classes (i.e. development from egg?pupae). 4. Competition within mixed-age, stage or species cohorts, when compared with uniform-aged or species cohorts, altered the position of a competitive environment on the scramble-contest spectrum. In some cases the competitive environment switched from undercompensatory contest to overcompensatory scramble competition. 5. Such switching modes of competition suggest that the relative importance of the mechanisms regulating single-species population dynamics (i.e. resource competition) may change when organisms are embedded within a wider community.

abstract = {Regime shifts are substantial, long-lasting reorganizations of complex systems, such as ecosystems. Large ecosystem changes such as eutrophication, shifts among vegetation types, degradation of coral reefs and regional climate change often come as surprises because we lack leading indicators for regime shifts. Increases in variability of ecosystems have been suggested to foreshadow ecological regime shifts. However, it may be difficult to discern variability due to impending regime shift from that of exogenous drivers that affect the ecosystem. We addressed this problem using a model of lake eutrophication. Lakes are subject to fluctuations in recycling associated with regime shifts, as well as fluctuating nutrient inputs. Despite the complications of noisy inputs, increasing variability of lake-water phosphorus was discernible prior to the shift to eutrophic conditions. Simulations show that rising standard deviation (SD) could signal impending shifts about a decade in advance. The rising SD was detected by studying variability around predictions of a simple time-series model, and did not depend on detailed knowledge of the actual ecosystem dynamics.},

LRPs should reflect a population's ability to con- tinue to persist, which depends on lifetime egg production (LEP) and current abundance. The unique characteristics of sea urchin fisheries, such as (i) tight ecological coupling, (ii) their being roe fisheries, (iii) protection of juveniles under adult spine canopies, and (iv) broadcast spawning, can influence their management. Most North American sea urchin fisheries developed rapidly. Their reference points include (i) several LRPs and TRPs based on the logistic or surplus production model, (ii) a unique TRP involving direct monitoring of the bathymetric position of their macro- phyte food, and (iii) an LRP based on the fraction of natural, unfished LEP. The dominant effect of fishing down and serial depletion on catch and effort data from developing sea urchin fisheries adversely affects fits to the logistic model. Reference points based on tight ecological coupling will be useful only where food webs are simple and one- dimensional. Sea urchin fisheries developed in the future should consider the fraction of natural LEP as an LRP and attempt to limit early excess fishing capacity.},

abstract = {Community assembly provides a conceptual foundation for understanding the processes that determine which and how many species live in a particular locality. Evidence suggests that community assembly often leads to a single stable equilibrium, such that the conditions of the environment and interspecific interactions determine which species will exist there. In such cases, regions of local communities with similar environmental conditions should have similar community composition. Other evidence suggests that community assembly can lead to multiple stable equilibria. Thus, the resulting community depends on the assembly history, even when all species have access to the community. In these cases, a region of local communities with similar environmental conditions can be very dissimilar in their community composition. Both regional and local factors should determine the patterns by which communities assemble, and the resultant degree of similarity or dissimilarity among localities with similar environments. A single equilibrium in more likely to be realized in systems with small regional species pools, high rates of connectance, low productivity and high disturbance. Multiple stable equilibria are more likely in systems with large regional species pools, low rates of connectance, high productivity and low disturbance. I illustrate preliminary evidence for these predictions from an observational study of small pond communities, and show important effects on community similarity, as well as on local and regional species richness.},

We examined trophic interactions between marine mammals and fisheries based on a resource overlap index, using seven {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Ecopath{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} models including marine mammal groups. On a global scale, most food consumed by marine mammals consisted of prey types that were not the main target of fisheries. For each ecosystem, the primary production required (PPR) to sustain marine mammals was less than half the PPR to sustain fisheries catches. We also developed an index representing the mean trophic level of marine mammal's consumption (TL{\textless}sub{\textgreater}Q{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) and compared it with the mean trophic level of fisheries' catches (TL{\textless}sub{\textgreater}C{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}).

As fisheries increasingly exploit lower-trophic level species, the competition with marine mammals may become more important. We used mixed trophic impact analysis to evaluate indirect trophic effects of marine mammals, and in some cases found beneficial effects on some prey. Finally, we assessed the change in the trophic structure of an ecosystem after a simulated extirpation of marine mammal populations. We found that this lead to alterations in the structure of the ecosystems, and that there was no clear and direct relationship between marine mammals' predation and the potential catch by fisheries. Indeed, total biomass, with no marine mammals in the ecosystem, generally remained surprisingly similar, or even decreased for some species.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Therefore, biological reference points (BRPs) for aggregated groups are required, which optimize yields while preventing overexploitation of individual species. We evaluate the tradeoffs between yield and biodiversity objectives for a wide range of aggregation strategies using multispecies surplus production models and comparing 2 simulated fish communities. We simulated population trajectories with an operating model de tailing predation and competitive interactions for all individual species within each community, and with additional stochastic environmental variability for one community. Species trajectories were then aggregated by functional feeding guild, taxonomy, habitat association, size class, and at the entire community level. We estimated production parameters and BRPs (e.g. maximum sustainable yield, MSY) using a simple assessment model applied to each aggregated time series, then we applied the MSY fishing rates to each simulated community as alternative fishing strategies and compared equilibrium biomass and yield under each strategy. We were able to define multi-species reference points to meet both yield and biodiversity objectives across full system, taxonomic, habitat, feeding, and size-based aggregations. Species complexes were best able to meet both objectives when species with broadly similar productivity, environmental sensitivity and species interactions were aggregated into the complex. The impacts of simulated environmental variability on BRPs were substantial for certain species and aggregates, so including the combined impacts of environmental variation and species interactions in precautionary reference points appears critical to EBFM.},

abstract = {Catastrophic collapses of top predators have revealed trophic cascades and community structuring by top-down control. When populations fail to recover after a collapse, this may indicate alternative stable states in the system. Overfishing has caused several of the most compelling cases of these dynamics, and in particular Atlantic cod stocks exemplify such lack of recovery. Often, competition between prey species and juvenile predators is hypothesized to explain the lack of recovery of predator populations. The predator is then considered to compete with its prey for one resource when small and to subsequently shift to piscivory. Yet predator life history is often more complex than that, including multiple ontogenetic diet shifts. Here we show that no alternative stable states occur when predators in an intermediate life stage feed on an additional resource (exclusive to the predator) before switching to piscivory, because predation and competition between prey and predator do not simultaneously structure community dynamics. We find top-down control by the predator only when there is no feedback from predator foraging on the additional resource. Otherwise, the predator population dynamics are governed by a bottleneck in individual growth occurring in the intermediate life stage. Therefore, additional resources for predators may be beneficial or detrimental for predator population growth and strongly influence the potential for top-down community control.},

These interactions change the pattern–process relationships across scales such that fine-scale processes can influence a broad spatial extent or a long time period, or broad-scale drivers can interact with fine-scale processes to determine system dynamics. Cross–scale interactions are increasing recognized as having important influences on ecosystem processes, yet they pose formidable challenges for understanding and forecasting ecosystem dynamics. In this introduction to the special feature, “Cross–scale interactions and pattern–process relationships”, we provide a synthetic framework for understanding the causes and consequences of cross–scale interactions. Our framework focuses on the importance of transfer processes and spatial heterogeneity at intermediate scales in linking fine- and broad-scale patterns and processes. Transfer processes and spatial heterogeneity can either amplify or attenuate system response to broad-scale drivers. Providing a framework to explain cross–scale interactions is an important step in improving our understanding and ability to predict the impacts of propagating events and to ameliorate these impacts through proactive measures.},

Such research is essential for advancing our understanding of ecological responses associated with climate change, and the physical and biological processes that control them. This need is perhaps greatest for ecosystems that display highly dynamic and spatially complex patterns that are difficult to explain with short-term, small-scale studies. Such is the case for kelp forest ecosystems, which often show tremendous spatial and temporal variability in resource supply, consumer control and physical disturbance across spatial scales of metres to hundreds of kilometres and temporal scales of hours to decades.

Here we synthesize the evidence for oceanic top-down control that has emerged over the last decade, focusing on large, high trophic-level predators inhabiting continental shelves, seas, and the open ocean. 3. In these ecosystems, where controlled manipulations are largely infeasible, 'pseudo-experimental' analyses of predator-prey interactions that treat independent predator populations as 'replicates', and temporal or spatial contrasts in predator populations and climate as 'treatments', are increasingly employed to help disentangle predator effects from environmental variation and noise. 4. Substantial reductions in marine mammals, sharks, and piscivorous fishes have led to mesopredator and invertebrate predator increases. Conversely, abundant oceanic predators have suppressed prey abundances. Predation has also inhibited recovery of depleted species, sometimes through predator-prey role reversals. Trophic cascades have been initiated by oceanic predators linking to neritic food webs, but seem inconsistent in the pelagic realm with effects often attenuating at plankton. 5. Top-down control is not uniformly strong in the ocean, and appears contingent on the intensity and nature of perturbations to predator abundances. Predator diversity may dampen cascading effects except where nonselective fisheries deplete entire predator functional groups. In other cases, simultaneous exploitation of predator and prey can inhibit prey responses. Explicit consideration of anthropogenic modifications to oceanic foodwebs should help inform predictions about trophic control. 6. Synthesis and applications. Oceanic top-down control can have important socio-economic, conservation, and management implications as mesopredators and invertebrates assume dominance, and recovery of overexploited predators is impaired. Continued research aimed at integrating across trophic levels is needed to understand and forecast the ecosystem effects of changing oceanic predator abundances, the relative strength of top-down and bottom-up control, and interactions with intensifying anthropogenic stressors such as climate change.},

abstract = {Spiny lobsters, Panulirus interruptus (Randall), are important predators of two species of sea urchins, Strongylocentrotus franciscanus (A. Agassiz) and S. purpuratus (Stimpson), which are major herbivores in southern California kelp forest communities. Aquarium experiments indicate that spiny lobsters strongly prefer S. purpuratus over S. franciscanus of comparable test diameter, probably accounting for the higher number of S. purpuratus mortalities observed in the field. Juvenile S. franciscanus ({\textless} 60 mm test diameter, TD) are preferred over larger conspecifics, but the smallest S. franciscanus ({\textless} 30 mm TD) are protected by association with the adult urchin spine canopy. Mid-sized S. franciscanus too large to fit under the spine canopy are subject to intense predation. All sizes of P. interruptus tested showed a notable reluctance to attack large S. franciscanus ({\textgreater} 90 mm TD) when offered a range of sizes, although the larger lobsters are capable of handling the largest urchins. Relative movement, spine length, test thickness, and gonad weights of sea urchins were examined to evaluate the factors affecting the lobsters' choice of prey, and behavioral responses to lobsters were assessed to determine urchin availability to these predators. The handling problems associated with the long spines of larger S. franciscanus appear to be the major considerations in prey choice despite the much greater potential energy gain from these urchins. Thus predation by spiny lobsters appears to be sufficient to explain the bimodal size-frequency distribution typical of S. franciscanus populations in areas where these predators are common. Heavy fishing pressure on spiny lobsters during this century probably resulted in the release of sea urchin populations and contributed to episodes of destructive urchin grazing observed in the 1950's and subsequent years. ?? 1983.},

abstract = {Life history theories attempt to explain the evolution of organism traits as adaptations to environmental variation. A model involving three primary life history strategies (endpoints on a triangular surface) describes general patterns of variation more comprehensively than schemes that examine single traits or merely contrast fast versus slow life histories. It provides a general means to predict a priori the types of populations with high or low demographic resilience, production potential, and conformity to density-dependent regulation. Periodic (long-lived, high fecundity, high recruitment variation) and opportunistic (small, short-lived, high reproductive effort, high demographic resilience) strategies should conform poorly to models that assume density-dependent recruitment. Periodic-type species reveal greatest recruitment variation and compensatory reserve, but with poor conformity to stockrecruitment models. Equilibrium-type populations (low fecundity, large egg size, parental care) should conform better to assumptions of density-dependent recruitment, but have lower demographic resilience. The model's predictions are explored relative to sustainable harvest, endangered species conservation, supplemental stocking, and transferability of ecological indices. When detailed information is lacking, species ordination according to the triangular model provides qualitative guidance for management and development of more detailed predictive models.},

abstract = {Abstract All instrumental climate records are affected by instrumentation changes and variations in sampling over time. While much attention has been paid to the problem of detecting "change points" in time series, little has been paid to the statistical properties of climate signals that result after adjusting ("homogenizing") the data - or to the effects of the irregular sampling and serial correlation exhibited by real climate records. These issues were examined here by simulating multistation datasets. Simple homogenization methods, which remove apparent artifacts and then calculate trends, tended to remove some of the real signal. That problem became severe when change-point times were not known a priori, leading to significant underestimation of real and/or artificial trends. A key cause is false detection of change points, even with nominally strict significance testing, due to serial correlation in the data. One conclusion is that trends in previously homogenized radiosonde datasets should be viewed with caution. Two-phase regression reduced but did not resolve this problem. A new approach is proposed in which trends, change points, and natural variability are estimated simultaneously. This is accomplished here for the case of incomplete data from a fixed station network by an adaptation of the "iterative universal Kriging" method, which converges to maximum-likelihood parameters by iterative imputation of missing values. With careful implementation this method's trend estimates had low random errors and were nearly unbiased in these tests. It is argued that error-free detection of change points is neither realistic nor necessary, and that success should be measured instead by the integrity of climate signals.},

abstract = {Previous studies conducted on a local scale emphasised the potential of trophic cascades in Mediterranean rocky reefs (involving predatory fish, sea urchins and macroalgae) in affecting the transition between benthic communities dominated by erected macroalgae and barrens (i.e., bare rock with partial cover of encrusting algae). Distribution patterns of fish predators of sea urchins (Diplodus sargus sargus, Diplodus vulgaris, Coris julis and Thalassoma pavo), sea urchins (Paracentrotus lividus and Arbacia lixula) and barrens, and fish predation rates upon sea urchins, were assessed in shallow (3-6 m depth) sublittoral rocky reefs in the northern, central and southern sectors of the eastern Adriatic Sea, i.e., on a large spatial scale of hundreds of kilometres. No dramatic differences were observed in predatory fish density across latitude, except for a lower density of small D. sargus sargus in the northern Adriatic and an increasing density of T. pavo from north to south. P. lividus did not show any significant difference across latitude, whereas A. lixula was more abundant in the southern than in the central Adriatic. Barrens were more extended in the southern than in the central and northern sectors, and were related with sea urchin density. Fish predation upon adult sea urchins did not change on a large scale, whereas it was slightly higher in the southern sector for juveniles when predation rates of both urchins were pooled. Results show that: (1) assemblages of predatory fish and sea urchins, and barren extent change across latitude in the eastern Adriatic Sea, (2) the weak relations between predatory fish density and predation rates on urchins reveal that factors other than top-down control can be important over large scale (with the caveat that the study was conducted in fished areas) and (3) patterns of interaction among strongly interacting taxa could change on large spatial scales and the number of species involved. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

Assumptions of fishery-only influences inferring constant, random, or depensatory parameters fared poorly (did not mimic history), as did climate influences indexed by tree ring growth. However, a model using both climate and depensation fared well, mimicking much documented history of Newfoundland cod, including declines during the Little Ice Age (mid- to late 19th century) and the stock collapses of the late 20th century, with a good fit to recent scientific surveys (r2 = 0.80). This model suggests temporal differentiation between fishing and climate effects, including (i) declines during the Little Ice Age (1800-1880) caused by lower productivity, (ii) collapses in the 1960s caused by overfishing, (iii) collapses in the late 1980s caused by both, and (iv) rebuilding now hindered by depensatory effects of low numbers.},

abstract = {Cod stocks in the North West Atlantic and the Baltic Sea have shown similar dynamics in recent decades with a rapid decline in abundance and a lack of stock recovery following a period of large biomass. We explore whether the lack of recovery can be ascribed to an emergent Allee effect, which is a mechanism intrinsic to the community in contrast to explanations involving environmental factors. We formulate a stage-structured biomass model for the cod-sprat interaction in the Baltic Sea, paying special attention to the size-dependent prey preference of differently sized cod. The model predicts that alternative community states can occur under the same environmental conditions, in which cod is either present or absent. In a stable equilibrium with its main prey cod has a strong effect on the prey size distribution, resulting in larger densities of preferred prey sizes for cod than in the absence of any predation. Cod thus shapes its food environment to its own benefit. Furthermore, in response to increased exploitation cod biomass and yield tend to increase unless a stock collapse is imminent. After a cod stock collapse and the consequent drop in predation the prey size distribution becomes stunted and offers insufficient food for cod to grow and recover. These results are consequences of the indirect effects of predation and harvesting, whereby increased mortality relaxes competition among surviving individuals, leading to an increase in food intake and hence increased somatic growth and reproduction. We review observed community changes following the collapse of the cod stocks in the North West Atlantic and the Baltic Sea in the light of model predictions. In line with our model predictions growth in body size of cod has slowed down after the collapse, despite high densities of prey biomass. Furthermore, estimates of total prey population fecundity in the Baltic Sea identify the emergent Allee effect as a potentially important mechanism contributing to the lack of cod recovery. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Two distinct organizational states of kelp forest communities, foliose algal assemblages and deforested barren areas, typically display sharp discontinuities. Mechanisms responsible for maintaining these state differences were studied by manipulating various features of their boundary regions. Urchins in the barren areas had significantly smaller gonads than those in adjacent kelp stands, implying that food was a limiting resource for urchins in the barrens. The abundance of drift algae and living foliose algae varied abruptly across the boundary between kelp beds and barren areas. These observations raise the question of why urchins from barrens do not invade kelp stands to improve their fitness. By manipulating kelp and urchin densities at boundary regions and within kelp beds, we tested the hypothesis that kelp stands inhibit invasion of urchins. Urchins that were experimentally added to kelp beds persisted and reduced kelp abundance until winter storms either swept the urchins away or caused them to seek refuge within crevices. Urchins invaded kelp bed margins when foliose algae were removed but were prevented from doing so when kelps were replaced with physical models. The sweeping motion of kelps over the seafloor apparently inhibits urchins from crossing the boundary between kelp stands and barren areas, thus maintaining these alternate stable states. Our findings suggest that kelp stands are able to defend themselves from their most important herbivores by combining their flexible morphology with the energy of wave-generated surge. The inhibitory influence of this interaction may be an important mechanism maintaining the patchwork mosaics of barren areas and kelp beds that characterize many kelp forest ecosystems.},

However, most existing attempts rely on linear approaches based on correlation, which cannot apply in complex, nonlinear natural systems, because correlation is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for causation. Applying empirical dynamic modelling that acknowledges nonlinear dynamics on nine subpopulations of tiger mosquitos from three neighbouring reef islets of the Raiatea atoll, we identified temperature, precipitation, dew point, air pressure, and mean tide level as causal environmental variables. Interestingly, responses of subpopulations in close proximity (100–500 m) differed with respect to their causal environmental variables and the time delay of effect, highlighting complexity in mosquito-environment causality network. Moreover, we demonstrated how to explore the effects of changing environmental variables on number and strength of mosquito outbreaks, providing a new framework for pest control and disease vector ecology.},

abstract = {Despite being one of the most common pieces of information used in assessing the status of fish stocks, relative abundance indices based on catch per unit effort (cpue) data are notoriously problematic. Raw cpue is seldom proportional to abundance over a whole exploitation history and an entire geographic range, because numerous factors affect catch rates. One of the most commonly applied fisheries analyses is standardization of cpue data to remove the effect of factors that bias cpue as an index of abundance. Even if cpue is standardized appropriately, the resulting index of relative abundance, in isolation, provides limited information for management advice or about the effect of fishing. In addition, cpue data generally cannot provide information needed to assess and manage communities or ecosystems. We discuss some of the problems associated with the use of cpue data and some methods to assess and provide management advice about fish populations that can help overcome these problems, including integrated stock assessment models, management strategy evaluation, and adaptive management. We also discuss the inappropriateness of using cpue data to evaluate the status of communities. We use tuna stocks in the Pacific Ocean as examples. ?? 2006 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

Most modeling of reserves employs simplifying assumptions about the behavior of fishermen in response to spatial closures. We show that a realistic depiction of fishermen behavior dramatically alters the conclusions about reserves. We develop, estimate, and calibrate an integrated bioeconomic model of the sea urchin fishery in northern California and use it to simulate reserve policies. Our behavioral model shows how economic incentives determine both participation and location choices of fishermen. We compare simulations with behavioral response to biological modeling that presumes that effort is spatially uniform and unresponsive to economic incentives. We demonstrate that optimistic conclusions about reserves may be an artifact of simplifying assumptions that ignore economic behavior. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

abstract = {Decision-makers charged with implementing ecosystem-based management (EBM) rely on scientists to predict the consequences of decisions relating to multiple, potentially conflicting, objectives. Such predictions are inherently uncertain, and this can be a barrier to decision-making. The Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources requires managers of Southern Ocean fisheries to sustain the productivity of target stocks, the health and resilience of the ecosystem, and the performance of the fisheries themselves. The managers of the Antarctic krill fishery in the Scotia Sea and southern Drake Passage have requested advice on candidate management measures consisting of a regional catch limit and options for subdividing this among smaller areas. We developed a spatially resolved model that simulates krill-predator-fishery interactions and reproduces a plausible representation of past dynamics. We worked with experts and stakeholders to identify (1) key uncertainties affecting our ability to predict ecosystem state; (2) illustrative reference points that represent the management objectives; and (3) a clear and simple way of conveying our results to decision-makers. We developed four scenarios that bracket the key uncertainties and evaluated candidate management measures in each of these scenarios using multiple stochastic simulations. The model emphasizes uncertainty and simulates multiple ecosystem components relating to diverse objectives. We summarize the potentially complex results as estimates of the risk that each illustrative objective will not be achieved (i.e., of the state being outside the range specified by the reference point). This approach allows direct comparisons between objectives. It also demonstrates that a candid appraisal of uncertainty, in the form of risk estimates, can be an aid, rather than a barrier, to understanding and using ecosystem model predictions. Management measures that reduce coastal fishing, relative to oceanic fishing, apparently reduce risks to both the fishery and the ecosystem. However, alternative reference points could alter the perceived risks, so further stakeholder involvement is needed to identify risk metrics that appropriately represent their objectives.},

Since 2000, Wildlife Services (WS), an agency of the US Department of Agriculture, has killed 2 million native mammals, predominantly 20 species of carnivores, beavers, and several species of ground-dwelling squirrels, but also many nontarget species. Many are important species in their native ecosystems (e.g., ecosystem engineers such as prairie dogs and beavers, and apex predators such as gray wolves). Reducing their populations, locally or globally, risks cascading negative consequences including impoverishment of biodiversity, loss of resilience to biotic invasions, destabilization of populations at lower trophic levels, and loss of many ecosystem services that benefit human society directly and indirectly. Lethal predator control is not effective at reducing depredation in the long term. Instead, we recommend that WS and its government partners involved in wildlife conflict management emphasize training livestock producers in methods of nonlethal control, with sparing use of lethal control by methods that are species-specific, and cease all lethal control in federal wilderness areas and for the purpose of enhancing populations of common game species.},

abstract = {Human-wildlife conflict has been receiving increased scientific and management attention, predominantly in terrestrial systems, as a side effect of successful predator conservation and recovery. These same conflicts exist in the ocean; however, they are mostly regarded in a region- or taxa-specific context despite evidence that human-wildlife conflict is prevalent across the global oceans and likely to increase as a result of successful conservation measures. Can the lessons learned from conflicts on land promote more sustainable success in the sea? Or, do ocean human-wildlife conflicts create unique challenges that require new solutions? This paper synthesizes evidence from human-wildlife conflicts in the ocean and provides initial suggestions for progressing with effective management in the ocean. Humans have extensive experience managing conflict with terrestrial predators and several of the strategies are transferable to marine predators, but several important differences between systems necessitate a marine-specific focus and evaluation of existing mitigation strategies. Further, in managing marine wildlife conflict, it is crucial to recognize that perceived conflicts can be just as important as actual conflict and that, in many cases, human-human conflict is at the root of human-wildlife conflict. As efforts to recover important predator populations continue, humans are faced with the exciting opportunity and a new necessity to constructively manage these recoveries to continue to meet goals for marine conservation while simultaneously promoting human safety and industry in the seas.},

Here we use two distinct data sets, one from kelp forests in the Channel Islands, California, and one from a global synthesis of marine reserves, to directly test how variation in species diversity translates into changes in functional diversity. We find strong positive relationships between species and functional diversity, and increased functional diversity of fish assemblages coinciding with recovery of species diversity in marine reserves, independent of the method used for classifying species in functional groups. These results indicate that low levels of redundancy in functional species traits exist across a suite of marine systems, and that fishing tends to remove whole functional groups from coastal marine ecosystems.},

Using depth measurements from data storage tags attached to individual crabs, daily acrossshelf movement rates were estimated as the daily change in crab depth divided by the slope (i.e., depth/horizontal distance) of the seafloor on which each crab resided each day. Rates and distances were analyzed at different time scales (day, month, year) and general additive models were used to test the significance of factors that could potentially influence the daily rate of movements. Individual crab rates averaged between 0.1 and 1.1 km/day over their time at liberty, with one individual attaining a maximum rate of 8 km/day. Rates varied significantly (P  {\textless}  0.05) with the bottom depth, season (day of year), and the release area. Although overall rates did not vary with crab size, maximum rates were highest among the smallest individuals, two of which (100-102 mm carapace width) traveled approximately 250 km in ten months. Movement rates were highest during spring when travel was directed mostly inshore, and slower during fall and winter when offshore movements occurred.

The diet of these fish consisted mainly of red algae (88.2{\%} by dry wt) and also small amounts of brown (7.8{\%}) and green (4.0{\%}) algae. The most important dietary item, the filamentous red algae Polysiphonia spp., was found in {\textgreater}78{\%} of the stomachs and comprised {\textgreater}60{\%} of the contents by dry weight. The digestive tract was long, on average 4.0 times the standard length of the fish, and was composed of the stomach, pyloric caeca, intestine, hindgut chamber with a blind caecum, and rectum. The mean pH of the cardiac stomach was acidic (3.9), whereas that of the intestine was nearly neutral (6.9) and that of the hindgut and blind caecum slightly acidic (6.3 and 6.6, respectively). Algal foods are apparently digested by acid lysis in the stomach and by microbial fermentation in the hindgut. Zebraperch assimilated nutritional constituents from six species of algae with varying degrees of efficiency:carbon (73.7 to 89.7{\%}), nitrogen (72.4 to 84.5{\%}), and protein (71.9 to 94.9{\%}). The fish assimilated these constituents as efficiently or more efficiently from three species of nondietary brown algae as from three species of dietary red and green algae. These results show that zebraperch, like their tropical and subtropical relatives (members of the genus Kyphosus), can digest a wide variety of algae including brown algae containing defensive secondary compounds.

Models of food density dynamics within such limited foraging areas predict that food availability and consumption per time spent feeding should depend strongly on juvenile density. Selection should act on the time that juveniles spend foraging, so as to strike a balance between growth and predation risk; we predict that optimum balance will occur at foraging times proportional to the minimum needed to reach viable simesfor later survival and reproduction plus an additional time inversely proportional to the predation risk per time. Combining the food availability and optimal foraging time predictions leads to stock-recruitment patterns similar to classic Beverton-Holt and Ricker forms, depending on how food organisms respond over time. Very strong density-dependent mortality can occur even without noticeable changes in juvenile growth rates or average food densities over large spatial scales, but intraspecific competitive effects should always be evident through density-dependent changes in foraging time},

abstract = {Despite more than a century of federal protection, the California sea otter Enhydra
lutris nereis remains threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA), and the
population has not appreciably expanded its range in two decades. Here, we examine
a novel dataset of 725 sea otter live strandings from 1984–2015 to gain insights into
demographic and environmental factors underlying threats to sea otter recovery in
California. Using multinomial logistic regression to evaluate spatiotemporal patterns
of stranding causes, we demonstrate that increases in stranding rates, particularly outside
the range center, are related to a substantial increase in shark bites. By contrast,
trauma linked to human activities has declined dramatically, and now accounts for
less than 5{\%} of stranding cases. Within the range core, where the sea otter population
seems regulated by prey availability, symptoms of energetic stress represent more than
63{\%} of all strandings and are strongly associated with high sea otter density. Conversely,
in range peripheries, the majority of strandings are caused by shark bite and
neurological disease. Notably, these threats are virtually absent where nearshore habitat
is characterized by at least 10{\%} kelp canopy cover. Our analyses reveal that declining
kelp cover may therefore constrain the population's spatial expansion and recovery in
two key ways. Absence of kelp intensifies density-independent threats in the range
peripheries, and likely limits dispersal of reproductive females, which depend on kelp
canopy for nursery habitat. These results highlight the significance of both top-down
and bottom-up processes in population dynamics, and inform an ecosystem-based
approach to conservation planning.},

While some monitoring studies do suffer from these problems, there are also many highly successful long-term monitoring programs that have provided important scientific advances and crucial information for environmental policy. Here, we discuss the characteristics of effective monitoring programs, and contend that monitoring should be considered a fundamental component of environmental science and policy. We urge scientists who develop monitoring programs to plan in advance to ensure high data quality, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness, and we urge government agencies and other funding institutions to make greater commitments to increasing the amount and long-term stability of funding for environmental monitoring programs.},

abstract = {The commercial fishery for the northern California red sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus franciscanus, began in 1985, peaked in 1989, and has declined steadily since that time. An alternative to traditional management is spatial management using no-take reserves that may improve the management of this and other fisheries. We formulated a size-structured metapopulation model with 24 patches and a dispersal matrix to address the key issue of larval linkages between reserve and fished patches. We explored four conceptual models of metapopulation connectivity including source-sink, limited distance, larval pool, and headlands dispersal models. These models indicated that the mode of dispersal led to potentially large differences in reserve performance. Larval pool models require little knowledge of spatial patterns in order to design an effective reserve network, while source-sink dynamics require a detailed understanding of larval dispersal if reserves are to be an effective means of fisheries management. Reserve networks can be optimized with knowledge of larval dispersal patterns; however, they are rarely known with certainty. A decision analysis used to evaluate alternative dispersal modes suggested a reserve system comprising approximately 25{\%} of the total area can maintain catch in the red sea urchin fishery, buffering uncertainty in the pattern of larval replenishment and fishing mortality rate.},

abstract = {In the Mediterranean Sea, such as in other temperate marine areas, the variation in sea urchin density in coastal rocky system may drive switches between one complex state, dominated by erect algae into barren state dominated by encrusting coralline algae and bare rock. The aim of this paper is to mathematically describe how fishing (predator exploitation) affects sea urchin abundance (prey) so that predictions about the effects of fishery restrictions on urchin density could be made. This also would indirectly provide forecast of macroalgal forests from barren. In order to obtain such description, a simple model of prey–predator dynamics in the presence of predator exploitation was evaluated by using a numerical simulation that parametrically explores the impact of external exploitation in the system equilibrium. The proposed model is consistent with observed alternative states in Mediterranean subtidal rocky bottoms. In fact, the presence of barren in areas both exploited and protected from fishing activity can be explained by hysteresis of the system. Moreover, an irreversible transition was shown to occur when the intrinsic growth rate of the prey decreases (predator restoration through fishing restrictions) suggesting that proper and complex management approaches should be considered to address conservation of a benthic habitat.},

abstract = {Recruitment from newly settled propagules is an important process in the population dynamics of many species, especially those living in highly disturbed areas and subjected to frequent local extinctions. For many primitive plants such as kelps (large brown algae in the order Laminariales), the process of recruitment (i.e., the first appearance of macroscopic individuals) is quite complex and requires the successful completion of an alternate microscopic free-living sexual stage. To experimentally investigate the conse- quences of variable spore settlement and early (i.e., prerecruit) competition on the recruit- ment patterns of the sympatric sublittoral kelps Macrocystis pyrifera and Pterygophora californica, I seeded bare rock substrates with known densities of spores of the two algae in both single- and mixed-species assemblages. Results from 12 field experiments done over 3 yr indicated that for both kelps, a minimum density of at least 1 spore/mm2 was needed for successful recruitment. This minimum density was probably determined in part by the maximum distance that could separate male and female gametophytes while still allowing fertilization to occur. Although greater spore density often resulted in higher numbers of sporophyte recruits, strong density-dependent mortality still occurred whenever there was recruitment. The requirement for spores to settle at relatively high densities (i.e., {\textgreater} 1 spore/mm2), coupled with the drastic difference in size between spores (0.01 mm) and early recruits (20 mm), insures that density-dependent mortality will occur at early stages in these algae. "Safe sites" for the recruitment of kelp were highly variable in time; recruitment of both kelps varied significantly among experiments and was negatively correlated with the natural recruitment of ephemeral species of filamentous brown algae. Differences in post- settlement mortality between Macrocystis and Pterygophora often caused patterns of spo- rophyte recruitment to vary from those of initial spore settlement. In monospecific treat- ments, the recruitment rates of the two kelps usually differed in the same experiment, indicating they responded differently to the same environmental conditions. In mixed- species treatments, interspecific competition between microscopic prerecruit stages also caused species-specific differences in early mortality. Pterygophora spore settlement gen- erally inhibited the recruitment of Macrocystis at both high (750-1500 spores/mm2) and low (10-20 spores/mm2) densities. Competition between the two kelps was asymmetrical; Macrocystis settlement had no effect on Pterygophora recruitment. Thus, changing envi- ronmental conditions and competition among early microscopic stages modified the ways in which spore settlement influenced sporophyte recruitment. The effects of these factors on kelp recruitment were interactive, and their relative importance will undoubtedly vary with species, location, and time},

abstract = {The red sea urchin S. franciscanus and the purple sea urchin S. purpuratus are important members of southern California USA kelp bed communities. Their population structures were studied in terms of patterns of recruitment and mortality at 3 sites in the Point Loma kelp forest near San Diego, California. Recruitment was annual and substantial at all sites. Several predators consume adult S. purpuratus, but only the spiny lobster Panulirus interruptus and the California sheephead fish Semicossyphus pulcher (a large labrid) prey on large S. franciscanus. Urchin test collections, small scale urchin distribution patterns and grazing mortality of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera suggest that lobsters and sheephead, both of which are harvested, control urchin populations. In the presence of these predators, the size-frequency distributions of S. franciscanus populations are bimodal, apparently because juveniles 40 mm) are protected by the spine canopies of adults, urchins of intermediate size (50-80 mm) are very vulnerable to predators and large adults 90 mm) attain a partial refuge in size. The population structure of S. purpuratus is unimodal, evidently because this species is less dependent on the spine canopy association and its short spines and smaller adult test dimensions do not allow it a refuge in size from predation.},

@article{Cury2005,
abstract = {Maintenance of overall ecosystem complexity is perceived as critical to the sustainability of ecosystem use. The development of an operational basis for an ecosystem approach to fisheries, however, faces many difficulties. On the research side, the challenge is in defining proper long-term, ecosystem-related objectives; determining meaningful reference values and indicators for desirable or undesirable states of the ecosystem; and developing appropriate data collection, analytical tools and models. The "viability" concept developed in economics by Jean-Pierre Aubin can be used to assist in the definition, selection of, and interaction among long-term objectives at an ecosystem level. It recognizes that ecosystems are complex assemblages of interacting and self-organizing natural and human components that cannot be predicted. Viability models define an ensemble of "viable states", in contrast to undesirable states defined as such by ecological, economic, and/or social constraints. These constraints can be derived from fisheries objectives, conservation principles, scientific results of modelling, or precautionary principles, and correspond to limit reference points to be avoided. Viability theory does not attempt to choose any "optimal solution" according to given criteria, but selects "viable evolutions". These evolutions are compatible with the constraints in the sense that they satisfy them at each time and can be delineated by the viability kernel. The southern Benguela marine ecosystem is presented as a first attempt for the application of this theory. In defining ecosystem-based objectives (and related issues such as target reference points), it seems more difficult to reach consensus among stakeholders on what is desirable than on what is undesirable (e.g. biological or economic collapse, species extinction, displacement of local rural communities). Expressed in the negative form or as limit reference points, ecosystem-based constraints can be considered simultaneously with current target reference points, such as maximum sustainable yield, using viability models. The viability approach can help to progressively integrate ecosystem considerations, such as conservation, into fisheries management. ?? 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

abstract = {Reliable information on historical and current population dynamics is central to understanding patterns of growth and decline in animal populations. We developed a maximum likelihood-based analysis to estimate spatial and temporal trends in age/sex-specific survival rates for the threatened southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis), using annual population censuses and the age structure of salvaged carcass collections. We evaluated a wide range of possible spatial and temporal effects and used model averaging to incorporate model uncertainty into the resulting estimates of key vital rates and their variances. We compared these results to current demographic parameters estimated in a telemetry-based study conducted between 2001 and 2004. These results show that survival has decreased substantially from the early 1990s to the present and is generally lowest in the north-central portion of the population's range. The greatest temporal decrease in survival was for adult females, and variation in the survival of this age/sex class is primarily responsible for regulating population growth and driving population trends. Our results can be used to focus future research on southern sea otters by highlighting the life history stages and mortality factors most relevant to conservation. More broadly, we have illustrated how the powerful and relatively straightforward tools of information-theoretic-based model fitting can be used to sort through and parameterize quite complex demographic modeling frameworks.},

abstract = {Differences in diet composition among conspecifics (dietary specialization) have been documented across a broad range of taxonomic groups and habitats, and such variation at the individual level is increasingly recognized as an important component of diversity in trophic interactions. Accurate identification of individual dietary specialization, however, requires longitudinal dietary records that are labor-intensive and cost-prohibitive to obtain for many species. Here we explore the use of stable isotopes (delta13C and delta15N) as a promising technique for detecting and quantifying patterns of individual dietary specialization. Southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis) offer a unique opportunity for testing this approach because (1) they consume a wide variety of prey that span multiple trophic levels, habitats, and ecologically defined functional groups; and (2) individual diet specialization can be validated with existing observational data. We analyzed the isotopic composition of sea otter vibrissae (n = 31) in order to characterize inter- and intra-individual variation in sea otter diets at Monterey Bay, California, USA. At the population level, sea otters showed substantial variation in both delta13C and delta15N values, occupying nearly all of the "isotopic space" created by the diversity of isotopic signatures of potential prey taxa. Most of the variation in sea otter vibrissae was accounted for by differences between individuals, with much less contributed by within-individual variation. A majority of sea otters (approximately 80{\%}) showed relatively little temporal variability in isotopic composition, suggesting that the proportional composition of most individuals' diets is relatively constant over time; a few individuals (approximately 20{\%}) exhibited a high degree of intra-vibrissa isotopic variability, suggesting seasonal shifts in diet composition. These results and our interpretation of them were supported by long-term observational data on the diets of radio-tagged sea otters from the same population (n = 23). Our results demonstrate that stable isotopes can provide an efficient tool for measuring individual- and population-level dietary breadth and may be useful for studying populations where longitudinal data on individuals would otherwise be impossible to acquire. This will be critical for examining the causes and consequences of dietary variation within and among consumer populations, thereby improving our understanding of these important ecological and evolutionary processes at the community level.},

abstract = {Changing targeting behavior of fishing fleets and zero-catch records of the target species are two characteristics common to many multi-species trawl fisheries. These features complicate analyses intended to produce indices of relative abundance from commercial catch rate data. Trawl catch rates of Patagonian grenadier caught off Southern Chile were used to calculate indices of relative abundance for this species. To allow for targeting behavior and zero catches, we first defined a subset of relevant tows combining a logistic regression on the species catch composition and knowledge about the persistence of Patagonian grenadier in the catches from the area where historically it has been more abundant. A standardization analysis was then conducted on this subset of the data using a generalized linear model (GLM) framework. Analysis of deviance tables and standard residuals GLM diagnostic plots were used for selecting the statistical models that best described the data. The candidate models tested were the delta-lognormal, delta-gamma, quasi-Poisson and compound Poisson. The models that best supported the Patagonian grenadier catch rate data were the delta-lognormal and compound Poisson models. Standardization models were then extended to generalized linear mixed models to include the vessel main effect and the significant interactions with the year effect as random effects. Estimations of the annual series of relative abundance were then obtained from the coefficients of the year effects of these models, both of which showed higher abundance for the years 2001--2008 than in previous years of the series. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the design of modelling tools suitable for investigating the consequences of alternative policies on the dynamics of resources and fisheries, such as the evaluation of marine protected areas (MPA). We first review the numerous models that have been developed for this purpose, and compare them from several standpoints: population modelling, exploitation modelling and management measure modelling. We then present a generic fisheries simulation model, Integration of Spatial Information for FISHeries simulation (ISIS-Fish). This spatially explicit model allows quantitative policy screening for fisheries with mixed-species harvests. It may be used to investigate the effects of combined management scenarios including a variety of policies: total allowable catch (TAC), licenses, gear restrictions, MPA, etc. Fisher's response to management may be accounted for by means of decision rules conditioned on population and exploitation parameters. An application to a simple example illustrates the relevance of this kind of tool for policy screening, particularly in the case of mixed fisheries. Finally, the reviewed models and ISIS-Fish are discussed and confronted in the light of the underlying assumptions and model objectives. In the light of this discussion, we identify desirable features for fisheries simulation models aimed at policy evaluation, and particularly MPA evaluation.},

abstract = {Conservation genetics is the science focused on the understanding of hereditary processes and mitigating factors that endanger populations at risk of extinction. It is an interdisciplinary specialty in which geneticists explore genetic variation, with the goal of enabling resource managers to better conserve biodiversity. Sea otters offer a unique case for the study and application of conservation genetics because of their documented history of population reduction and recovery from the fur trade of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Population genetic studies using microsatellites and mitochondrial (mt) DNA have found low genetic diversity within modern sea otters compared to those sampled during the fur trade. Many sea otter populations remain fragmented and isolated today, more than 100 years after the fur trade ended, although they maintain historical genetic structuring based on analysis of both pre- and post-fur trade populations. Translocations to augment recovery in areas where sea otters remained absent have resulted in recovery of some of the lost genetic diversity. In addition to studies of genetic diversity, genetic methods such as allozymes, mtDNA restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, microsatellites, and direct sequencing have been used to determine genetically distinct populations and stocks to inform management decisions. Newer research on adaptive genetics has investigated portions of the genome responsible for individual and population health, such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and gene expression, reporting varying levels of diversity and expression. Here we review the methods and results of past genetic studies, explore future directions for sea otter conservation genetics, and discuss the implications of genetic research for the long-term conservation of sea otter populations.},

abstract = {Global, repeat satellite imagery serves as an essential tool to understand ecological patterns and processes over diverse temporal and spatial scales. Recently, the use of spaceborne imagery has become indispensable for monitoring giant kelp, a globally distributed foundation species that displays variable seasonal and interannual dynamics. In order to develop and maintain a continuous and spatially expansive time series, we describe a fully automated protocol to classify giant kelp canopy biomass across three Landsat sensors. This required correcting kelp canopy estimates to account for changes in the spectral response functions between the three sensors by simulating data using hyperspectral imagery. Combining multiple sensors also necessitated the use of an extended (15 year) time series of diver estimated kelp biomass to validate each sensor. We also describe a novel gap filling technique using known spatial scales of kelp biomass synchrony to correct for missing data due to the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus scan line corrector failure. These developments have led to a publicly available 34-year, seasonal time series of kelp canopy biomass across {\~{}}1500 km of California coastline. We then use this time series to examine the role of temporal and spatial scale on the detection of long-term biomass trends. We found that kelp canopy biomass trends are associated with trends in low frequency marine climate oscillations, like the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation. Long-term ({\~{}}20 year) increases in the state of the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation have led to a cooler, nutrient-rich environment that benefits the growth of giant kelp across a large portion of the kelp biomass time series, however recent warming events have led to weak, or nonexistent trends over the length of the time series. The cyclical nature of these low frequency marine climate oscillations complicates the detection of trends that may be associated with anthropogenic climate change. A longer and continuous time series is needed to analyze long-term canopy biomass trends outside of natural low frequency climate variability for giant kelp ecosystems along the coast of California, if we are to make accurate assessments of the impacts of climate change.},

This functional response largely determines dynamic stability, responses to environmental influences and the nature of indirect effects in the food web containing the predator- prey pair. Nevertheless, measurements of functional responses in nature are quite rare. Recently, much work has been devoted to comparing two idealized forms of the functional response: prey dependent and ratio dependent. Although we agree that predator abundance often affects the consumption rate of individual predators, this phenomenon requires more attention. Disagreement remains over which of the two idealized responses serves as a better starting point in building models when data on predator dependence are absent.},

Records consisted of 13,847 individual dives from 841 feeding bouts ranging from 1 min to.4 h. Average dive time was 55 s60.9 SE and average surface time was 45 s62.3 SE, irrespective of dive success. At least 77{\%} of all dives (n ¼ 10,636) were successful prey captures (dives in low light or of undetermined success were excluded). Prey capture success was significantly lower for subadults (63{\%} 6 5 SE) than adults (82{\%} 6 1 SE; P , 0.001). Sea otters occupying the established population range on the outer coast of Washington fed heavily on bivalves (63{\%}) and had a diverse diet consisting of several prey groups (n ¼ 10). In contrast, sea otters occupying new habitat in the Strait of Juan de Fuca had a restricted diet dominated by .60{\%} red urchins (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus), with only 2 other prey species comprising .10{\%} of their diet. Prey size and prey category were dominant predictor variables in generalized linear models of dive duration and postdive surface duration on successful dives. Significant increases in areal extent of surface canopy of giant kelp (Macrocystis integrifolia) and bull kelp (Nereocystis leutkeana) were found both in the outer coast and the Strait of Juan de Fuca (0.4–0.5 km2 per year, P , 0.05) and suggest increasing suitable habitat for a growing population. The growth and expansion of a small and isolated sea otter population provides a unique opportunity to examine the relationship between dietary diversity and population status and explore similarities and differences between trophic paradigms established for sea otter populations at other localities.},

We simulated the dynamics of three species with different intrinsic growth rates and survey catchabilities over 50 years in the presence of fishing and a single fisheryindependent survey. Schaefer surplus production models with and without time-varying growth rate and catchability were fitted to simulated data. We then compared the ability of each model to accurately estimate multispecies maximum sustainable yield and terminal year biomass and to accurately reflect overall trends in individual component stocks. All models produced biased estimates, but the accuracy of multispecies assemblage maximum sustainable yield was improved with the incorporation of time-varying parameters. The terminal biomass of the assemblage was best estimated by a basic production model in two of three scenarios. Multispecies assemblage trends were not reflective of all individual component species, resulting in situations in which some species were overexploited and others underexploited. Although the incorporation of time-varying parameters improved the accuracy of some estimates in this application, the direction and magnitude of bias may not be predictable unless the relative differences in growth rate and catchability among species in the assemblage are known. If single-species surplus production models are the only viable option for modeling assemblages, precautionary reference points should be adopted. Scaling the level of precaution to the range of growth rates among species in the assemblage is recommended.},

abstract = {The extent to which different grazers are functionally redundant has strong implications for the maintenance of community structure and function. Grazing by red urchins (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) on temperate rocky reefs can initiate a switch from invertebrate or macroalgal dominance to an algal crust state, but can also cause increases in the density of molluscan mesograzers. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that red urchins and lined chitons (Tonicella spp.) are redundant in the maintenance of available space, defined as encrusting algae and bare rock. In a factorial field experiment replicated at three sites, we reduced the densities of urchins and chitons on subtidal rock walls for nine months. The effects of grazers were interpreted in the context of natural temporal variation by monitoring the benthic community one year before, during, and after grazer removal. The removal of each grazer in isolation had no effect on the epilithic community, but the removal of both grazers caused an increase in sessile invertebrates. The increase was due primarily to clonal ascidians, which displayed a large (∼75{\%}) relative increase in response to the removal of both grazers. However, the observed non-additive responses to grazer removal were temporary and smaller than seasonal fluctuations. Our data demonstrate that urchins and chitons can be redundant in the maintenance of available space, and highlight the value of drawing conclusions from experimental manipulations within an extended temporal context.},

abstract = {Understanding whether recruitment fluctuations in fish stock arise from stochastic forcing (e.g. environmental variations) rather than deter- ministic forces (e.g. intrinsic dynamics) is a long standing question with important applied consequences for fisheries ecology. In particular, the relationship between recruitment, spawning stock biomass and environmental factors is still poorly understood, even though this aspect is crucial for fisheries management. Fisheries data are often short, but arise from complex dynamical systems with a high degree of stochastic forcing, which are difficult to capture through classic modelling approaches. In the present study, recent statistical approaches based on the approximation of the attractors of dynamical systems are applied on a large dataset of time series to assess (i) the directionality of potential causal relationships between recruitment and spawning stock biomass and potential influence of sea-surface temperature on recruitment and (ii) their performance to forecast recruitment. Our study shows that (i) whereas spawning stock biomass and sea surface temperature influ- ence the recruitment to a lesser extent, recruitment causes also parental stock size and (ii) that non-linear forecasting methods performed well for the short-term predictions of recruitment time series. Our results underline that the complex and stochastic nature of the processes characterizing recruitment are unlikely to be captured by classical stock–recruitment relationships, but that non-linear forecasting methods provide interesting perspectives in that respect.

abstract = {Community composition, species abundance, and species distribution are expected to change while monitoring ecosystems over time, and effective management of natural resources requires understanding mechanisms contributing to change. Marine ecosystems in particular can be difficult to monitor, in part due to large, multidimensional spatial scales and complex dynamics. However, within the temperate marine ecosystems, the nearshore food web is reasonably well described. This food web is ecologically and socially important, spatially constrained, and has been the focus of extensive experimental research that describes the underlying mechanisms important to system dynamics. Here, we describe a monitoring program initiated in 2006 that focuses on the nearshore benthic food web in the Gulf of Alaska, whose design anticipates potential causes of ecosystem change to improve rigor, resolution, and confidence in understanding the mechanisms underlying change. We established 15 long-term monitoring sites across more than 1000 km of coastline, including 10 within two national parks and 5 within Prince William Sound, area of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. The program evaluates six ecological indicators and more than 200 species that range from primary producers to top-level consumers, and is designed to examine both bottom-up and top-down dynamics. Employing a design that allows broad spatial inference and selecting species with direct food-web linkages, we demonstrate the ability of our monitoring program to simultaneously detect change and assess potential mechanisms underlying that change. Detecting change and understanding mechanisms can help guide management and conservation policy. Specifically, we provide an example focusing on the sea otter (Enhydra lutris) that illustrates how (1) analytical methods are used to evaluate changes on various scales and infer potential mechanisms of change, (2) food-web linkages can enhance the understanding of changes and their effects, and (3) data can be used to inform management.},

abstract = {Abstract. Red sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus), residing in shallow hab- itats in Bodega Bay, California are morphologically distinct and possibly enhance recruit- ment by spawning larvae and sheltering juveniles. This suggests shallow beds of urchins would be ideal candidates for harvest refugia promoting the production of larvae to replenish deeper harvested habitats. Red urchins from shallow beds (5 m) had significantly heavier gonads (63 + 30 g, N = 45, mean ? 1 SD) compared with urchins from intermediate (14 m) and deep (23 m) habitats (12 + 8 g, N = 39, mean + 1 SD). Gonad indices from spring, summer, and fall of 1991 and 1992 show this pattern persisted. Shallow water urchins co- occurred at high densities (4.6 individuals/M2), with seasonally abundant drift algae and wave surge. Recruitment of juvenile urchins was examined in nine -iM2 quadrats randomly. placed in three shallow sites with red urchins and three intermediate depth sites with red urchins in the Bodega Marine Reserve. Juvenile urchin (Strongylocentrotus spp.) recruit- ment (5-50 mm) was highest in association with adults in shallow habitats over a 4-yr period (October 1988-October 1992). Adult red urchins in shallow habitats resided in rock "bowls" where they were 12 times more likely to shelter juveniles than more mobile adults in deep water. Principal component analysis identified five morphological characteristics of shallow water urchins: short spines, large gonads, thick tests, small lanterns, and small peristomial openings. External morphological characteristics (e.g., spine length) could be used to ensure the protection of reproductive urchins in shallow harvest refugia offering an alternative urchin management strategy for northern California.

abstract = {Recognizing that all management decisions have impacts on the ecosystem being exploited, an ecosystem-based approach to management seeks to better inform these decisions with knowledge of ecosystem structure, processes and functions. For marine fisheries in the California Current, along the West Coast of North America, such an approach must take into greater consideration the constantly changing climate-driven physical and biological interactions in the ecosystem, the trophic relationships between fished and unfished elements of the food web, the adaptation potential of life history diversity, and the role of humans as both predators and competitors. This paper reviews fisheries-based ecosystem tools, insights, and management concepts, and presents a transitional means of implementing an ecosystem-based approach to managing US fisheries in the California Current based on current scientific knowledge and interpretation of existing law.},

abstract = {Due to vertical variations in ocean circulation, larval Northeast Arctic cod Gadus morhua may influence their own drift routes by migrating vertically. By coupling a larval individualbased model and a general circulation model, we simulated larval vertical positioning according to simple rules based on individual risk sensitivity. This enabled us to investigate how larval growth, survival and horizontal distribution vary between individuals following different rules. Immediate depth selection follows from the rules, with implications for environmental exposure and instantaneous growth rates. The behavioural rules had long-term and large-scale consequences, since vertical positioning influences the drift trajectory of the larva, and thereby the physical environment the larva experiences along its way. Two alternative rule formulations were explored, each containing the full range of strategies, from maximising immediate growth to maximising immediate survival. Fitness was defined as accumulated survival probability up to 18 mm for larvae released at 2 important spawning grounds in the Lofoten area. Both rules gave better fitness than for individuals drifting at fixed depths. The most successful individuals performed active vertical migration and had an intermediate risk sensitivity. When risk sensitivity was allowed to change with ontogeny, larvae that first emphasised growth and then changed to intermediate risk sensitivity were the most successful ones, although improvements were minor compared to fixed sensitivities. The 2 spawning grounds led to slight differences in fitness, but success as a result of risk sensitivity was similar at both, suggesting that optimal larval strategies may be robust across different spawning grounds.},

abstract = {Recent studies document unprecedented declines in marine top predators that can initiate trophic cascades. Predicting the wider ecological consequences of these declines requires understanding how predators influence communities by inflicting mortality on prey and inducing behavioral modifications (risk effects). Both mechanisms are important in marine communities, and a sole focus on the effects of predator-inflicted mortality might severely underestimate the importance of predators. We outline direct and indirect consequences of marine predator declines and propose an integrated predictive framework that includes risk effects, which appear to be strongest for long-lived prey species and when resources are abundant. We conclude that marine predators should be managed for the maintenance of both density- and risk-driven ecological processes, and not demographic persistence alone. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Various ecological processes influence patterns of species diversity at multiple spatial scales. One process that is potentially important but rarely considered is community assembly. I assembled model communities using species pools of differing size to examine how the history of community assembly may affect multi-scale diversity patterns. The model contained three scales at which diversity could be measured: local community, metacommunity, and species pool. Local species saturation occurred, as expected from the competition and predation built in the model. However, local communities did not become resistant to invasions except when the species pool was very small. Depending on dispersal rate and trophic level, the larger the species pool, the harder it was to predict which species invades which local community at a given time. Consequently, local-community dissimilarity maintained by assembly history increased linearly with pool size, even though local diversity was decoupled from pool size. These results have two implications for multi-scale diversity patterns. First, assembly history may provide an explanation for scale-dependent relationships between local and regional diversity: assembly causes the relationship to be curvilinear at one scale (local community), while linear at another (metacommunity). Second, assembly history influences how gamma-diversity is partitioned into alpha- and beta-diversity: assembly causes the relative contribution of beta to increase with pool size. Overall, this study suggests that community assembly history interacts with species pool size to regulate multi-scale patterns of species diversity.},

abstract = {We contrasted body condition, and age-specific reproduction and mortality between a growing population of sea otters (Enhydra lutris) at Kodiak Island and a high-density near-equilibrium population at Amchitka Island, Alaska. We obtained data from marked individuals, population surveys, and collections of beach-cast carcasses. Mass:length ratios indicated that females (but not males) captured in 1992 at Amchitka were in poorer condition than those captured at Kodiak in 1986-1987. In 1993, the condition of females at Amchitka improved in apparent response to two factors: (1) an episodic influx of Pacific smooth lumpsuckers, Aptocyclus ventricocus, from the epi-pelagic zone, which otters consumed; and (2) an increase in the otters' benthic invertebrate prey resulting from declining otter numbers. Reproductive rates varied with age (0.37 [CI=0.21 to 0.53] births female-1 yr-1 for 2-3-yr-olds, and 0.83 [CI=0.69 to 0.90] for females {\textgreater}=4 yr old), and were similar at both areas. Weaning success (pups surviving to {\textgreater}=120 d), in contrast, was almost 50{\%} lower at Amchitka than at Kodiak and for females {\textgreater}=4 yr of age was 0.52 (CI=0.38 to 0.66) vs 0.94 (CI=0.75 to 0.99), respectively. Sixty-two percent of the preweaning pup losses at Amchitka occurred within a month of parturition and 79{\%} within two months. Postweaning survival was also low at Amchitka as only 18{\%} of instrumented pups were known to be alive one year after mother-pup separation. Adult survival rates appeared similar at Amchitka and Kodiak. Factors affecting survival early in life thus are a primary demographic mechanism of population regulation in sea otters. By maintaining uniformly high reproductive rates over time and limiting investment in any particular reproductive event, sea otters can take advantage of unpredictable environmental changes favorable to pup survival. This strategy is consistent with predictions of "bet-hedging" life history models.},

abstract = {Interactions between seals and the fishing industry are an on-going problem in Ireland and indeed globally across the range of most seal species. These interactions occur at both the operational (seal damage to catches and fishing gear) and biological (competition for shared resources) level. With declines in fish stocks there has been increased interest in the extent of competition for resources between commercial fisheries and seals. High levels of seal damage perceived by the fishing industry has led to frequent calls for seal culls, highlighting the significance of the problem. However, the scale of interaction between seals and commercial fishing and aquaculture in Ireland heretofore remained unclear. A comprehensive review of existing data, augmented with data from key stakeholders on the current state of play is presented to provide a realistic and representative account of the situation. This suggests that seal interactions with commercial fisheries in Ireland are most significant in inshore ({\textless}12 nautical miles from shore) static-net (or passive) fisheries (e.g. gill/tangle nets) and have increased following the driftnet ban in 2006, which suggests displacement of seal interactions from salmon to other fisheries. The industry highlighted pollack, angler fish, cod, and turbot fisheries as the main inshore fisheries currently impacted by operational damage to gear and catch by seals. Seal damage to line-caught salmon continues, with industry feedback suggesting large geographical variation in the range of damage levels reported. Salmon farming installations are also increasingly being targeted by seals, with significant losses due to seal depredation being reported. In the absence of robust data on seal depredation, the extent to which changes in fishing gear and practices have reduced damage levels, or resulted in displacement of seal foraging effort, is unknown. Recommendations are made to suggest how research efforts should be focused to address critical data gaps identified in the study. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, the annual emission rate in the US has remained relatively stable between 2001–2006 while the emission rate in China has more than doubled, apparently eclipsing that of the US in late 2006. Here we present the seasonal and spatial pattern of CO2 emissions in China, as well as the sectoral breakdown of emissions. Though our best point estimate places China in the lead position in terms of CO2 emissions, we qualify this statement in a discussion of the uncertainty in the underlying data (3–5{\%} for the US; 15–20{\%} for China). Finally, we comment briefly on the implications of China's new position with respect to international agreements to mitigate climate change.},

abstract = {Kelp forests, highly diverse cold water communities organized around the primary productivity and physical structure provided by members of the Laminariales, support a variety of fisheries, and the kelp itself is harvested for alginates. Worldwide, these communities generally share susceptibility to destructive overgrazing by sea urchins. The impact of sea-urchin grazing is governed by the ratio between food availability and grazing pressure, thus factors affecting the abundance of both urchins and kelps are central to ecosystem integrity. Some kelp ecosystems share a second generality, the association of exploitation of various urchin predators with destructive levels of urchin grazing, leading to cascading implications for other species dependent on the produc- tivity and habitat provided by the kelps. Competition between abalones and sea urchins also affects some kelp communities. These ecosystem-structuring processes are complicated by a variety of bottom-up and top-down factors, including variability in ocean climate affecting kelp productivity and recruitment of key species, and echinoid disease. Potential ecosystem effects of fisheries for predators, abalones, sea urchins, and kelps are reviewed biogeographically. Given the hundreds to thousands of years that many nearshore marine ecosystems have been exploited, no-take marine reserves may be the only way to determine the true ecosystem effects of fishing.},

Offshore, deep water directional wave buoys are used to initialize a non-stationary, linear, spectral refraction wave model. Model hindcasts of spectral parameters commonly used in nearshore process studies and engineering design are validated against nearshore buoy observations seaward of the surfzone. The buoy-driven wave model shows significant skill at most validation sites, but prediction errors for individual swell or sea events can be large. Model skill is high in north San Diego County, and low in the Santa Barbara Channel and along the southern Monterey Bay coast. Overall, the buoy-driven model hindcasts have relatively low bias and therefore are best suited for quantifying mean (e.g. monthly or annual) nearshore wave climate conditions rather than extreme or individual wave events. Model error correlation with the incident offshore wave energy, and between neighboring validation sites, may be useful in identifying sources of regional modeling errors.},

Although most of these changes have important ecological and at times economic implications, they remain notoriously difficult to detect in advance. Here, we study changes in the stability of populations under stress across a variety of transitions. Using a Ricker-type model, we simulate shifts from stable point equilibrium dynamics to cyclic and irregular boom–bust oscillations as well as abrupt shifts between alternative attractors. Our aim is to infer the loss of population stability before such shifts based on changes in nonlinearity of population dynamics. We measure nonlinearity by comparing forecast performance between linear and nonlinear models fitted on reconstructed attractors directly from observed time series. We compare nonlinearity to other suggested leading indicators of instability (variance and autocorrelation). We find that nonlinearity and variance increase in a similar way prior to the shifts. By contrast, autocorrelation is strongly affected by oscillations. Finally, we test these theoretical patterns in datasets of fisheries populations. Our results suggest that elevated nonlinearity could be used as an additional indicator to infer changes in the dynamics of populations under stress.},

abstract = {Ecological succession has been the subject of intense study and debate throughout the history of ecology as conceptualizations of process were proposed and refined. Modern concepts view ecological succession as largely driven by bottom-up resource competition for light and nutrients. However, growing evidence shows that top-down effects of consumers can govern succession. These contrasting perspectives require synthesis. We offer such a synthesis by revitalizing the hypothesis that succession proceeds by abrupt transitions to alternative states or dynamic regimes. We present evidence from field sampling along two successional gradients in a New England old field aimed at identifying pattern, and from experimentation in the same field aimed at identifying process. Field sampling revealed that a competitive dominant plant existed in a mosaic with two distinct patch types of relative abundances ({\textless}= 25{\%} and {\textgreater} 30{\%}). Competitive dominant plant abundance varied systematically with plant species diversity (evenness), and resource supply (light and soil nitrogen). The six-year field experiment tested for alternative regimes by systematic removal and staggered reintroduction of top predators. Long-term predator removal caused an abrupt and irreversible shift from a top-down to a bottom-up controlled regime with a breakpoint at approximately 25{\%} relative abundance of the competitive dominant plant. This caused significant shifts in plant species evenness and resource supply (solar radiation and N mineralization rate). Moreover, the competitive dominant abundance, species evenness and resource supply in the two dynamic regimes matched levels in the different patch types in the field. We conclude that a single ecosystem can display both top-down and bottom-up control. Abrupt shifts in trophic control lead to abrupt changes in the rate of development of ecosystems consistent with a working hypothesis that succession proceeds via abrupt regime shifts.},

abstract = {Spatial distribution of palatable and unpalatable plants can influence the foraging behaviour of herbivores, thereby changing plant-damage probabilities. Moreover, the immediate proximity to certain plants can benefit other plants that grow below them, where toxicity or spines act as a physical barrier or concealment against herbivores. This paper presents the results of a multi-scale experiment performed to test the effect of shrubs as protectors of tree saplings against herbivores and the mechanism involved in Mediterranean ecosystems.We performed a factorial design in two mountain ranges, similar in physiognomy and vegetation, planting saplings of a palatable tree, the maple (Acer opalus subsp. granatense), and an unpalatable tree, the black pine (Pinus nigra), under three different types of shrubs. We considered four experimental microhabitats: highly palatable shrub (Amelanchier ovalis) , palatable but spiny shrub (Crataegus monogyna or Prunus ramburii), unpalatable spiny shrub (Berberis vulgaris subsp. australis ) and control (gaps of bare soil without shrubs). Three main factorswere found to determine the probability of sapling attack: sapling palatability, experimental microhabitat and plot. Palatable saplings (maples) were browsed much more than unpalatable ones (pines). The degree of protection provided by the shrub proved greater as its palatability decreased with respect to sapling palatability, the unpalatable spiny shrub being the safest microhabitat for palatable saplings and bare soil for unpalatable ones. The differences found in number of attacked saplings between plots may be attributable to differences in herbivore pressure. The community context in which interaction takes place, namely the characteristics of the neighbours and the intensity of herbivore pressure, are determining factors for understanding and predicting the damage undergone by a target plant species. The mechanism that best explains these results is associational avoidance of saplings that grow near to unpalatable shrubs. It is necessary to introduce this neighbour effect in theoretical models and food-web approaches that analyse the plant?/ herbivore relationships, since it can strongly determine not only the intensity of the interaction, but also the spatial distribution and diversity of the plant community.

abstract = {Growth and survival of the red sea urchin Strongylocentrotus franciscanus were studied at 18 sites from southern California to Alaska, USA. Growth was determined using tetracycline tagging and was modeled using the Tanaka growth equation. Survival rates were estimated using size-frequency distributions and growth parameters. Using log-linear analysis, it was determined that growth transitions differed among sites (p much less than 0.001) but there was no north-south difference (p {\textgreater} 0.80). Parameters for the Tanaka growth function were estimated for all data combined (N = 2714). Residuals for sites showed no latitudinal trend and so results were consistent with the log-linear analysis. Relative jaw (demi-pyramid) size, measured as the allometric exponent beta in jaw length as a function of test diameter, has been shown to be responsive to available food. For red sea urchins, beta was negatively correlated with growth but there was no correlation of relative jaw size with latitude, which suggests that latitudinal differences in food availability do not exist. In contrast with annual growth rates, annual survival rates were correlated with latitude and were higher in the north. Mean annual survival probability was 0.93 yr(-1) from northern California to Alaska and 0.77 yr(-1) in southern California. Likely causes for changes in survival rate with latitude are disease and temperature-related stress. This paper provides the basis for development of hypotheses for size and survival differences between northern and southern populations of red sea urchins and, potentially, for other marine species with planktonic larvae.},

abstract = {Using long-term data on two kangaroo rats in the Chihuahuan Desert of North America, we fitted logistic models including the exogenous effects of seasonal rainfall patterns. Our aim was to test the effects of intraspecific interactions and seasonal rainfall in explaining and predicting the numerical fluctuations of these two kangaroo rats. We found that logistic models fit both data sets quite well; Dipodomys merriami showed lower maximum per capita growth rates than Dipodomys ordii, and in both cases logistic models were nonlinear. Summer rainfall appears to be the most important exogenous effect for both rodent populations; models including this variable were able to predict independent data better than models including winter rainfall. D. merriami was also negatively affected by another kangaroo rat (Dipodomys spectabilis), consistent with previous experimental evidence. We hypothesized that summer rainfall influences the carrying capacity of the environment by affecting seed availability and the intensity of intraspecific competition.},

The factors that drive this variability in the southern limit were examined by: (1) quantifying the abundances of M. pyrifera and the subsurface stipitate kelp, Eisenia arborea (Areschoug), near M. pyrifera's then southern limit at Punta San Roque (27{\^{A}}°15{\^{A}}¢N; 114{\^{A}}°42{\^{A}}¢W) on ten occasions between August 1997 and June 2002 (prior to and following the 1997/1998 El Nino Southern Oscillation); (2) initiating a field manipulation at Punta San Roque in June 2000 to examine competition between these two kelp species; and (3) surveying 20 additional sites near Punta San {\^{A}}´ Hipolito (27{\^{A}}°01{\^{A}}¢N; 114{\^{A}}°00{\^{A}}¢W) in June 2002 to determine whether M. pyrifera populations had recovered to their pre-1982/1983 El Nino southern range limit after {\"{E}}{\oe} 20 years of absence.

An inverse relationship was observed between these two species over the 5-year study. The field experiment showed that at both 4 months and 1 year after areas occupied by E. arborea were cleared, substantial recruitment of M. pyrifera occurred, while recruitment was negligible in uncleared areas. This study suggests that the southern range limit of M. pyrifera is determined by increased mortality and recruitment failure following the warm temperatures and low nutrient conditions associated with El Ninos, limited substrate availability, and by competition with the more persistent populations of E. arborea.},

abstract = {Heightening human impacts on the Earth result in widespread losses of production and conservation values and make large-scale ecosystem restoration increasingly urgent. Tackling this problem requires the development of general guiding principles for restoration so that we can move away from the ad hoc, site- and situation-specific approach that now prevails. A continuum of restoration efforts can be recognized, ranging from restoration of localized highly degraded sites to restoration of entire landscapes for production and/or conservation reasons. We emphasize the importance of developing restoration methodologies that are applicable at the landscape scale. Key processes in restoration include identifying and dealing with the processes leading to degradation in the first place, determining realistic goals and measures of success, developing methods for implementing the goals and incorporating them into land-management and planning strategies, and monitoring the restoration and assessing its success. Few of these procedures are currently incorporated in many restoration projects. The concept that many ecosystems are likely to exist in alternative stable states, depending on their history, is relevant to the setting of restoration goals. A range of measures, such as those being developed to measure ecosystem health, could be used to develop “scorecards” for restoration efforts. Generalizable guidelines for restoration on individual sites could be based on the concepts of designed disturbance, controlled colonization, and controlled species performance. Fewer explicit guidelines are available at the landscape scale, beyond nonquantitative generalities about size and connectivity. Development of these guidelines is an important priority so that urgent large-scale restoration can be planned and implemented effectively.},

abstract = {The assessment of population status is a central goal of applied wildlife research and essential to the field of wildlife conservation. "Population status" has a number of definitions, the most widely used having to do with the current trajectory of the population (i.e., growing, stable, or declining), or the probability of persistence (i.e., extinction risk), perhaps without any specific knowledge as to the factors driving a population's dynamics. In contrast, a population's status relative to the carrying capacity of the environment (. K) is an ecologically-based definition that explicitly provides information about a major mechanism of population control. That is, it relates to the relative per capita availability of resources to individuals in a population, which can also be used to infer the state of the environment itself.Sea otters in the North Pacific provide an excellent system with which to examine various approaches to assessing population status relative to K. This is because sea otters were nearly extirpated by historic commercial overexploitation in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, followed by natural and translocation-aided population recovery during the twentieth century, and this decline and recovery has been relatively well documented. This provided a unique opportunity to study populations at the extremes of the population status spectrum. Here we describe and review the approaches that have been utilized in sea otter research to understand the status of populations relative to resource abundance. Specifically, we will illustrate the utility of various indices of population status for understanding population dynamics using the case study of a second precipitous sea otter decline in the Western Aleutians. The indices or "tools" described here fit into several broad categories including (1) energetic, (2) morphological, and (3) demographic as well as a fourth category of emerging tools that have not yet been employed in many other situations including dietary diversity, community structure, spatial distribution, and gene expression.Overall, a variety of indices used to measure population status throughout the sea otter's range have provided insights for understanding the mechanisms driving the trajectory of various sea otter populations, which a single index could not, and we suggest using multiple methods to measure a population's status at multiple spatial and temporal scales. The work described here also illustrates the usefulness of long-term data sets and/or approaches that can be used to assess population status retrospectively, providing information otherwise not available. While not all systems will be as amenable to using all the approaches presented here, we expect innovative researchers could adapt analogous multi-scale methods to a broad range of habitats and species including apex predators occupying the top trophic levels, which are often of conservation concern.},

abstract = {Biological reference points (BRPs) are widely used to define safe levels of harvesting for marine fish populations. Most BRPs are either minimum acceptable biomass levels or maximum fishing mortality rates. The values of BRPs are determined from historical abundance data and the life-history parameters of the fish species. However, when the life-history parameters change over time, the BRPs become moving targets. In particular, the natural mortality rate of prey species depends on predator levels; conversely, predator growth rates depend on prey availability. We tested a suite of BRPs for their robustness to observed changes in natural mortality and growth rates. We used the relatively simple Baltic Sea fish community for this sensitivity test, with cod as predator and sprat and herring as prey. In general, the BRPs were much more sensitive to the changes in natural mortality rates than to growth variation. For a prey species like sprat, fishing mortality reference levels should be conditioned on the level of predation mortality. For a predator species, a conservative level of fishing mortality can be identified that will prevent growth overfishing and ensure stock replacement. These first-order multispecies interactions should be considered when defining BRPs for medium-term (5-10 year) management decisions.},

abstract = {—Kelp forest communities are highly variable over space and time. Despite this complexity it has been suggested that kelp forest communities can be classified into one of 2 states: kelp dominated or sea urchin dominated. It has been further hypothesized that these represent " alternate stable states " because a site can remain in either of these states for decades before some perturbation causes a rapid shift to the other state. Our research group has maintained a subtidal community monitoring program for 38 years at San Nicolas Island consisting of twice-annual scuba-based surveys at 6 sites distributed within 4 regions around the island. Three types of perturbations are thought to be relevant to subtidal community dynamics at San Nicolas: (1) physical disturbances in the form of major storm and El Ni{\~{n}}o/ Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events; (2) invertebrate diseases, which periodically decimate urchin populations; and (3) the reintroduction and subsequent increase of sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis). These 3 perturbations differ in spatial and temporal specificity; physical disturbances and disease outbreaks occur periodically and could affect all 4 regions, while sea otter predation has been concentrated primarily at the West End sites over the last 15 years. The different types of perturbations and the duration of the time series at the kelp forests at San Nicolas make the data set ideal for testing the " alternate stable state " hypothesis. We use nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to examine spatial and temporal patterns of community similarity at the 4 regions. In particular, we evaluate support for the existence of stable states, which are represented on NMDS plots as distinct spatial clusters. Community dynamics at each site approximated a biased random walk in NMDS space, with one or more basins of attraction and occasional jumps between basins. We found evidence for alternative stable states at some sites, and we show that transitions from one stable state to another may be influenced by interactions between multiple perturbations.

abstract = {There is a critical need for quantitative models that can help evaluate trade-off decisions related to the impacts of harvesting and protection of aquatic ecosystems within an ecosystem context. Ecosystem models used to evaluate such trade-offs need to have the capability of capturing the dynamic stability that can arise when predator-prey interactions are restricted to spatial and temporal arenas. Foraging arenas appear common in aquatic systems and are created by a wide range of mechanisms, ranging from restrictions of predator distributions in response to predation risk caused by their own predators, to risk-sensitive foraging behaviour by their prey. Foraging arenas partition the prey in each predator-prey interaction in a food web into vulnerable and invulnerable states, with exchange between these states potentially limiting overall trophic flow. Inclusion of vulnerability exchange processes in models for recruitment processes and food web responses to disturbances like harvesting leads to very different predictions about dynamic stability, trophic cascades and maintenance of ecological diversity than do models based on large-scale mass action (random mixing) interactions between prey and predators. Although a number of methods to estimate these critical exchange rates are presented, none are considered fully satisfactory. The most important challenge for the practical application of models that incorporate foraging arena theory today is not only developing new or improved methods for measuring exchange rates but also evaluating how such rates vary in responses to major fishery-induced changes in abundances of predators.},

abstract = {The assemblage of plants and animals living within a stand of Macrocystis pyrifera ofT the coast ofsouthern California was studied from July 1967 through February 1973. Macrocystis is a perennial kelp, with some individuals living as long as 7 yr; however, the average life span in this bed was approximately 3 to 4 yr. Physical disturbances associated with storms were the major mortality causes of adult Macrocystis in this area. Once detached, these plants drift through the bed and become entangled with other plants which results in extensive mortality. The fact that germination was greatest after the surface canopy was thinned by natural attrition and commercial harvesting suggests that light is a critical factor influencing the recruitment of Macrocystis. There was little indication to show that sea urchin grazing contributed to kelp mortality. Faunal species identified included 38 fish species and 98 invertebrate species. Of these, 14 species of macroinvertebrates were chosen for more intensive study as they represented common or char- acteristic species in the kelp bed. Patterns of distribution and abundance were recorded during the study period. Most species had aggregated distribution patterns and the populations of most remained reasonably constant over 4.25 yr. Styela montereyensis (ascidian) fluctuated annually and the Muricea californica (octocorall population slowly decreased during this time.

abstract = {While the species level effects of marine reserves are widely recognized, community level shifts due to marine reserves have only recently been documented. Protection from fishing of top predators may lead to trophic cascades, which have community-wide implications. Disease may act in a similar manner, regulating population levels of dominant species within a community. Two decades of data from the Channel Islands National Park Service's Kelp Forest Monitoring database allowed us to compare the effects of fishing and urchin disease on rocky reef community patterns and dynamics. Different size-frequency distributions of urchins inside and outside of reserves indicated reduced predation on urchins at sites where fishing removes urchin predators. Rocky reefs inside reserves were more likely to support kelp forests than were fished areas. We suggest that this results from cascading effects of the fishery on urchin predators outside the reserves, which releases herbivores (urchins) from predation. After periods of prevalent urchin disease, the reef community shifted more towards kelp forest assemblages. Specific groups of algae and invertebrates were associated with kelp forest and barrens communities. The community dynamics leading to transitions between kelp forests and barrens are driven by both fishing and disease; however the fishery effect was of greater magnitude. This study further confirms the importance of marine reserves not only for fisheries conservation, but also for the conservation of historically dominant community types.},

Yet with each aspect of stochasticity leading to some new or unexpected behaviour, the time is right to move beyond the familiar refrain of " everything is important " (Bj{\o}rnstad {\&} Grenfell 2001). Stochastic phenomena can suggest new ways of inferring process from pattern, and thus spark more dialog between theory and empirical perspectives that best advances the field as a whole. I highlight a few compelling examples, while observing that the study of stochastic phenomena are only beginning to make this translation into empirical inference. There are rich opportunities at this interface in the years ahead.},

abstract = {For an ecological monitoring program to be successful over the long-term, the perceived benefits of the information must justify the cost. Financial limitations will always restrict the scope of a monitoring program, hence the program's focus must be carefully prioritized. Clearly identifying the costs and benefits of a program will assist in this prioritization process, but this is easier said than done. Frequently, the true costs of monitoring are not recognized and are, therefore, underestimated. Benefits are rarely evaluated, because they are difficult to quantify. The intent of this review is to assist the designers and managers of long-term ecological monitoring programs by providing a general framework for building and operating a cost-effective program. Previous considerations of monitoring costs have focused on sampling design optimization. We present cost considerations of monitoring in a broader context. We explore monitoring costs, including both budgetary costs, what dollars are spent on, and economic costs, which include opportunity costs. Often, the largest portion of a monitoring program budget is spent on data collection, and other, critical aspects of the program, such as scientific oversight, training, data management, quality assurance, and reporting, are neglected. Recognizing and budgeting for all program costs is therefore a key factor in a program's longevity. The close relationship between statistical issues and cost is discussed, highlighting the importance of sampling design, replication and power, and comparing the costs of alternative designs through pilot studies and simulation modeling. A monitoring program development process that includes explicit checkpoints for considering costs is presented. The first checkpoint occurs during the setting of objectives and during sampling design optimization. The last checkpoint occurs once the basic shape of the program is known, and the costs and benefits, or alternatively the cost-effectiveness, of each program element can be evaluated. Moving into the implementation phase without careful evaluation of costs and benefits is risky because if costs are later found to exceed benefits, the program will fail. The costs of development, which can be quite high, will have been largely wasted. Realistic expectations of costs and benefits will help ensure that monitoring programs survive the early, turbulent stages of development and the challenges posed by fluctuating budgets during implementation.},

We used these to explore the effects of model structure and parameter uncertainty on predictions of the effects of different management regimes using continuation and bifurcation analysis. We considered five different func- tional responses and used the Akaike Information Criterion for model selection. The best models involved laissez-faire Holling Type III-shaped functional responses and the worst one corresponded to the Ecosim form. These models showed many similar behaviours but also showed marked differences in some exploitation scenarios. This suggests that using a single model structure as the basis for managing these stocks could lead to misleading, and potentially danger- ous, conclusions.},

abstract = {Evidence has accumulated that climate variability influences the state and functioning of marine ecosystems. At the same time increasing pressure from exploitation and other human activities has been shown to impact exploited and non-exploited species and potentially modify ecosystem structure. There has been a tendency among marine scientists to pose the question as a dichotomy, i.e., whether (1) "natural" climate variability or (2) fishery exploitation bears the primary responsibility for population declines in fish populations and the associated ecosystem changes. However, effects of both climate and exploitation are probably substantially involved in most cases. More importantly, climate and exploitation interact in their effects, such that climate may cause failure in a fishery management scheme but that fishery exploitation may also disrupt the ability of a resource population to withstand, or adjust to, climate changes. Here, we review how exploitation, by altering the structure of populations and ecosystems, can modify their ability to respond to climate. The demographic effects of fishing (removal of large-old individuals) can have substantial consequences on the capacity of populations to buffer climate variability through various pathways (direct demographic effects, effects on migration, parental effects). In a similar way, selection of population sub-units within meta-populations may also lead to a reduction in the capacity of populations to withstand climate variability and change. At the ecosystem level, reduced complexity by elimination of species, such as might occur by fishing, may be destabilizing and could lead to reduced resilience to perturbations. Differential exploitation of marine resources could also promote increased turnover rates in marine ecosystems, which would exacerbate the effects of environmental changes. Overall (and despite the specificities of local situations) reduction in marine diversity at the individual, population and ecosystem levels will likely lead to a reduction in the resilience and an increase in the response of populations and ecosystems to future climate variability and change. Future management schemes will have to consider the structure and functioning of populations and ecosystems in a wider sense in order to maximise the ability of marine fauna to adapt to future climates. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Sea urchin barrens are benthic communities on rocky subtidal reefs that are dominated by urchins and coralline algae; in the absence of intense herbivory by urchins, these barrens support luxuriant seaweed communities such as kelp beds (or forests). Barrens can extend over 1000s of km of coastline or occur in small patches (10s to 100s of m) within a kelp bed. They are characterized by low primary productivity and low food-web complexity relative to kelp communities and are generally considered a collapsed state of the kelp ecosystem. To assess the stability of sea urchin barrens and potential for return to a kelp-dominated state, we document temporal and spatial patterns of occurrence of barrens along temperate and polar coasts. We examine the various drivers of phase (or regime) shifts in these areas, the threshold levels of urchin abundance that trigger abrupt changes in ecosystem state, and the feedback mechanisms that stabilize each state. Although longitudinal (decadal) studies are limited, we find evidence in several regions that transitions between barrens and kelp beds are characterized by discontinuous phase shifts, with different thresholds for forward (to barrens) and reverse (to kelp beds) shifts, in accordance with alternative stable-state dynamics. In other areas, barrens may reflect regime shifts associated with large-scale oceanographic changes. Accelerating climate change and increasing{\&}{\#}xa0;anthropogenic impacts play important roles in altering alternative stable-state dynamics and triggering phase shifts. Recovery of the kelp state may be possible through management or remediation measures, but this necessitates a clear understanding of the thresholds and stabilizing factors for a given system.},

abstract = {The net effects of interspecific species interactions on individuals and populations vary in both sign ({\`{A}}, 0, +) and magnitude (strong to weak). Interaction outcomes are context-dependent when the sign and/or magnitude change as a function of the biotic or abiotic context. While context dependency appears to be common, its distribution in nature is poorly described. Here, we used meta-analysis to quantify variation in species interaction outcomes (competition, mutualism, or predation) for 247 published articles. Contrary to our expectations, variation in the magnitude of effect sizes did not differ among species interactions, and while mutualism was most likely to change sign across contexts (and predation least likely), mutualism did not strongly differ from competition. Both the magnitude and sign of species interactions varied the most along spatial and abiotic gradients, and least as a function of the presence/absence of a third species. However, the degree of context dependency across these context types was not consistent among mutualism, competition and predation studies. Surprisingly, study location and ecosystem type varied in the degree of context dependency, with laboratory studies showing the highest variation in outcomes. We urge that studying context dependency per se, rather than focusing only on mean outcomes, can provide a general method for describing patterns of variation in nature.},

abstract = {Foundation species define the ecosystems they live in, but ecologists have often characterized dominant plants as foundational without supporting evidence. Giant kelp has long been considered a marine foundation species due to its complex structure and high productivity; however, there is little quantitative evidence to evaluate this. Here, we apply structural equation modelling to a 15-year time series of reef community data to evaluate how giant kelp affects the reef community. Although species richness was positively associated with giant kelp biomass, most direct paths did not involve giant kelp. Instead, the foundational qualities of giant kelp were driven mostly by indirect effects attributed to its dominant physical structure and associated engineering influence on the ecosystem, rather than by its use as food by invertebrates and fishes. Giant kelp structure has indirect effects because it shades out understorey algae that compete with sessile invertebrates. When released from competition, sessile species in turn increase the diversity of mobile predators. Sea urchin grazing effects could have been misinterpreted as kelp effects, because sea urchins can overgraze giant kelp, understorey algae and sessile invertebrates alike. Our results confirm the high diversity and biomass associated with kelp forests, but highlight how species interactions and habitat attributes can be misconstrued as direct consequences of a foundation species like giant kelp.},

abstract = {Intraspecific variation in behavior and diet can have important consequences for population and ecosystem dynamics. Here, we examine how differences in reproductive investment and spatial ecology influence individual diet specialization in male and female southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis). We hypothesize that greater reproductive constraints and smaller home ranges of females lead to more pronounced intraspecific competition and increased specialization. We integrate stable carbon ($\delta$(13)C) and nitrogen ($\delta$(15)N) isotope analysis of sea otter vibrissae with long-term observational studies of five subpopulations in California. We define individual diet specialization as low ratios of within-individual variation (WIC) to total population niche width (TNW). We compare isotopic and observational based metrics of WIC/TNW for males and females to data on population densities, and movement patterns using both general linear and linear mixed-effects models. Consistent with our hypothesis, increasing population density is associated with increased individual diet specialization by females but not by males. Additionally, we find the amount of coastline in a sea otter's home range positively related with individual dietary variability, with increased range span resulting in weaker specialization for both males and females. We attribute our results to sex-based differences in movement, with females needing to specialize in their small ranges to maximize energy gain, and posit that the paradigm of individual prey specialization in sea otters with increased intraspecific competition may be a pattern driven largely by females. Our work highlights a potentially broader role of sex in the mechanistic pressures promoting and maintaining diet specialization.},

abstract = {Sea otters Enhydra lutris can be bycaught and drowned in fishing pots and traps, which may pose a threat to the welfare of otter populations. We explored this potential problem and its solutions using a wide variety of analyses. We exposed live California (USA) sea otters to finfish traps, lobster traps, and mock Dungeness crab traps in captive trials and found that the animals attempted to enter the circular and rectangular fyke openings, with some becoming entrapped. Using both live and dead sea otters, we found that a 3 × 9 inch (7.6 × 22.9 cm) fyke opening (1 inch narrower than the 4 × 9 inch [10.2 × 22.9 cm] openings currently used in California's commercial Dungeness crab fishery) would exclude most free-living (i.e. weaned from their mothers) otters while permitting the undiminished capture of crabs. Observer programs do not currently exist in California for these fisheries, so we calculated the effort required by an observer program to document sea otter bycatch over a range of hypothetical levels and evaluated the impact of those mortality rates on population growth. These analyses demonstrate that significant mortality from bycatch might easily go undetected, even with seemingly high levels of observer effort. As sea otters reoccupy portions of their former habitat in California, co-occurrence with finfish and shellfish traps with relatively large fyke openings will increase. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2011.},

There are, however, important differences between the "traditional" doctor-patient-client relationship paradigm associated with the health management of individual animals, and the manner in which health and disease are evaluated and interpreted in populations of animals. It comes as no surprise that animals in the wild die from one or combinations of a myriad of causes. Therefore, if one examines a large enough number of animals, you will find some that are, in fact, critically ill and dying. It is important to recognize that the veterinarian's role in conservation medicine is not to "cure every sick sea otter," but rather to provide insight into the etiopathogenesis, the epidemiology, and the implications of these diseases. This information may then be integrated into the bigger population picture involving wildlife ecology, natural history, environmental factors, and demography, all of which are critically important in the understanding, and therefore the preservation, of sea otter populations.},

Alternative hypotheses about present stock size correspond to alternative hypotheses about the scalar, so that by specifying an estimate of the current stock size or exploitation rate, the entire trend of surplus production can be calculated. An example, using monkfish (Lophius americanus) in the eastern United States, is given that shows quite robust conclusions to alternative assumptions about current stock size, and the analysis suggests that the surplus production from monkfish has been the highest during the period of lowest stock size.},

@article{Hernandez2009,
abstract = {Many recent reviews discuss the adequacy of definitions and metrics for the strength of population interactions. However, the discussion on the beneficial or detrimental nature of interactions is clearly absent, or at the most, inadvertently merged into the strength debate. This deficiency is emerging with the increasing interest in theoretical studies of interactions that shift in their nature; e.g. associations that present a mixture of mutualistic and antagonistic aspects, such as pollination; or species with changes in role, such as mutualistic ants that predate on aphid partners. By exploring these models, major controversies are revealed underlying some traditional perspectives: the original Levins' community matrix reformulated into interaction and jacobian matrices, that is, interaction coefficients reinterpreted as partial derivatives, fail to recognize the ecological context of interactions. The 'effect of one species on the other' is not necessarily quantified by 'the effect of varying species densities'; and shifts in the signs of jacobian elements do not correspond to shifts in types of interaction but to stability properties. Thus, the generalised use of these approaches must be revised. On the other hand, the comparison of ultimate performances of populations when growing alone or in association, here referred to as the relative performance approach, conceptually represents the original meaning of the community matrix. This conception, although measured at population levels, is a reflection of properties at the individual level. This article inspects and discusses the formalities and ecological contexts of these approaches to characterization by means of known population interaction models: linear and non-linear, variable and non-variable; aiming to disentangle crucial conceptions that are usually mingled in the literature: the strength (magnitude) and the nature (detrimental or beneficial) of the interaction, which are sometimes used interchangeably, and the stability properties of the system, which have been misleadingly associated with the latter. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Fish stocks fluctuate both in abundance and productivity (net population increase), and there are many examples demonstrating that productivity increased or decreased due to changes in abundance caused by fishing and, alternatively, where productivity shifted between low and high regimes, entirely unrelated to abundance. Although shifts in productivity regimes have been described, their frequency and intensity have not previously been assessed. We use a database of trends in harvest and abundance of 230 fish stocks to evaluate the proportion of fish stocks in which productivity is primarily related to abundance vs. those that appear to manifest regimes of high or low productivity. We evaluated the statistical support for four hypotheses: (i) the abundance hypothesis, where production is always related to population abundance; (ii) the regimes hypothesis, where production shifts irregularly between regimes that are unrelated to abundance; (iii) the mixed hypothesis, where even though production is related to population abundance, there are irregular changes in this relationship; and (iv) the random hypothesis, where production is random from year to year. We found that the abundance hypothesis best explains 18.3{\%} of stocks, the regimes hypothesis 38.6{\%}, the mixed hypothesis 30.5{\%}, and the random hypothesis 12.6{\%}. Fisheries management agencies need to recognize that irregular changes in productivity are common and that harvest regulation and management targets may need to be adjusted whenever productivity changes.},

However, stock productivity may shift with future climate change, with unknown consequences for sustainable harvesting, biomass targets and recovery timelines. Here we develop a stochastic modelling framework to characterize variability in the intrinsic productivity parameter (r) and carrying capacity (K) for 276 global fish stocks worldwide. We use models of dynamic stock productivity fitted via Bayesian inference to forecast rebuilding timelines for depleted stocks. In scenarios without fishing, recovery probabilities are reduced by 19{\%}, on average, relative to models assuming static productivity. Fishing at 90{\%} of the maximum sustainable rate depresses recovery probabilities by 42{\%}, on average, relative to static models. This work reveals how a changing environmental context can delay the rebuilding of depleted fish stocks, and provides a framework to account for the potential impacts of environmental change on the productivity of wildlife populations more broadly.},

The contribution of kelp detritus to coastal planktonic food webs has not previously been examined.

Our findings challenge the paradigm that phytoplankton are the main diet for zooplankton in nearshore regions, with implications for modeling of ocean production. Furthermore, at the benthic adult stage, sea urchins can destructively graze kelps causing the kelp ecosystem to collapse; hence, our results have implications for understanding feedback mechanisms that may determine the resilience of kelp ecosystems.},

They live in environments that alternate between two stable states: luxuriant, species-rich kelp forests and sea urchin-dominated "barrens." The transition from one state to the other can be initiated by several factors, including the abundance of algal food, predators, storm intensities, and incidence of disease. Purple sea urchins compete with other grazers, some of which are important fishery resources (such as abalones and red sea urchins), and they are harvested for scientific research. Revelations from their genome will lead to a better understanding of how they maintain their ecological importance, and may in turn enhance their economic potential.},

abstract = {Climate change is driving large changes in the spatial and temporal distributions of species, with significant consequences for individual populations. Community- and ecosystem-level implications of altered species distributions may be complex and challenging to anticipate due to the cascading effects of disrupted interactions among species, which may exhibit threshold responses to extreme climatic events. Toxic, bloom-forming cyanobacteria like Microcystis are expected to increase worldwide with climate change, due in part to their high temperature optima for growth. In addition, invasive zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) have caused an increase in Microcystis aeruginosa, a species typically associated with eutrophication, in low-nutrient lakes. We conducted a 13-year study of a M. aeruginosa population in a low-nutrient lake invaded by zebra mussels. In 10 of the 13 years there was a significant positive relationship between M. aeruginosa biomass and accumulated degree days, which are projected to increase with climate change. In contrast, Microcystis biomass was up to an order of magnitude lower than predicted by the above relationship during the other three years, including the warmest in the dataset, following repeated heat-induced mass mortality of D. polymorpha. Thus, the positive relationship between Microcystis biomass and temperature was negated when its facilitating species was suppressed during a series of exceptionally warm summers. Predicting the net response of a species to climate change may therefore require, at minimum, quantification of responses of both the focal species and species that strongly interact with it over sufficiently long time periods to encompass the full range of climatic variability. Our results could not have been predicted from existing data on the short-term responses of these two interacting species to increased temperature.},

abstract = {Niche- based approaches to community analysis often involve estimating a matrix of pairwise interactions among species (the “community matrix”), but this task becomes infea- sible using observational data as the number of modeled species increases. As an alternative, neutral theories achieve parsimony by assuming that species within a trophic level are exchange- able, but generally cannot incorporate stabilizing interactions even when they are evident in field data. Finally, both regulated (niche) and unregulated (neutral) approaches have rarely been fitted directly to survey data using spatiotemporal statistical methods. We therefore pro- pose a spatiotemporal and model- based approach to estimate community dynamics that are partially regulated. Specifically, we start with a neutral spatiotemporal model where all species follow ecological drift, which precludes estimating pairwise interactions. We then add regula- tory relations until model selection favors stopping, where the “rank” of the interaction matrix may range from zero to the number of species. A simulation experiment shows that model selection can accurately identify the rank of the interaction matrix, and that the identified spa- tiotemporal model can estimate the magnitude of species interactions. A 40- yr case study for the Gulf of St. Lawrence marine community shows that recovering grey seals have an unregu- lated and negative relationship with demersal fishes. We therefore conclude that partial regula- tion is a plausible approximation to community dynamics using field data and hypothesize that estimating partial regulation will be expedient in future analyses of spatiotemporal community dynamics given limited field data. We conclude by recommending ongoing research to add explicit models for movement, so that meta- community theory can be confronted with data in a spatiotemporal statistical framework.},

Understanding, preserving, and restoring connectivity in complex landscapes requires connectivity models and metrics that are reliable, efficient, and process based. We introduce a new class of ecological connectivity models based in electrical circuit theory. Although they have been applied in other disciplines, circuit-theoretic connectivity models are new to ecology. They offer distinct advantages over common analytic connectivity models, including a theoretical basis in random walk theory and an ability to evaluate contributions of multiple dispersal pathways. Resistance, current, and voltage calculated across graphs or raster grids can be related to ecological processes (such as individual movement and gene flow) that occur across large population networks or landscapes. Efficient algorithms can quickly solve networks with millions of nodes, or landscapes with millions of raster cells. Here we review basic circuit theory, discuss relationships between circuit and random walk theories, and describe applications in ecology, evolution, and conservation. We provide examples of how circuit models can be used to predict movement patterns and fates of random walkers in complex landscapes and to identify important habitat patches and movement corridors for conservation planning.},

The interactions can be even more important than the species themselves for understanding how the whole system is functioning and organized. For the representation of the topological space of interspecific relationships, graph theory is a suitable mathematical tool: the network perspective and the various techniques of network analysis are more and more elaborated and invading ecology. Beyond a static view on networks, fundamental questions can only be answered if dynamical analyses are also made, and now it is clear that structural and dynamical studies must not "compete" but strongly complement each other. Our aim is to give a menu of classical and more recently suggested network indices and to discuss what do we know about their relations to ecosystem dynamics. Since ecologists have very diverse problems, they need diverse techniques and a good insight in matching the adequate method to a particular problem. The main question is how to link certain graph properties to understanding and predicting the behaviour of an ecosystem.

Over the last 26 years, kelp abundance showed high spatial autocorrelation in western areas of Straits of Juan de Fuca, with more variable populations in the annual species and eastward towards Puget Sound. Both species covaried positively in their abun- dance throughout most of the study area, suggesting that environmental factors rather than competition, drove their dynamics. The population dynamics of these kelp species showed that the abundance 1 year previously was an important pre- dictor, and cyclic dynamics were not indicated using ARIMA models. Kelp abun- dance correlated inversely with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Oceanic Nino Index, and positively with the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, indicating that large-scale processes associated with colder seawater temperatures were associ- ated with greater relative abundance of kelp. 4. Synthesis. Kelp beds in the northern California Current Large Marine Ecosystem have mostly remained persistent over the past century and over many kilometres, but some areas may have decreased in abundance. The sensitivity of these popula- tions to indices of ocean climate, our demonstration that a historic 93-year sea surface temperature record (Race Rocks, Canada) showed a 0.72°C increase and the classification of some areas as high variability-low abundance, suggest that the viability of these foundational species remain a concern into the future.},

abstract = {We took differences in environmental and advantage of regional forcing consumer abundance to examine the relative importance of nutrient availability (bottom-up), and storm waves grazing pressure (top-down), (disturbance) in determining the standing biomass and net primary production (NPP) of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera in central and southern California. a nine-year data set collected Using from 17 sites we show that, despite high densities of sea urchin grazers and prolonged periods of low nutrient availability in southern NPP by giant kelp was twice that of central California where nutrient California, concentrations were consistently high and sea urchins were nearly absent due to predation by sea otters. Waves associated with winter storms were consistently higher in central California, and the loss of kelp biomass to winter wave disturbance was on average twice that of southern California. These observations that the more intense wave disturbance in central suggest California limited NPP by giant kelp under otherwise favorable conditions. Regional patterns of interannual variation in NPP were similar to those of wave disturbance in that year-to-year variation in disturbance and NPP were both greater in southern California. Our findings strong evidence that regional differences in wave disturbance overwhelmed those of provide nutrient supply and grazing intensity to determine NPP by giant kelp. The important role of disturbance in controlling NPP revealed by our study is likely not unique to giant kelp forests, as vegetation in many systems are dominated succession with dynamics by post-disturbance climax communities being relatively uncommon. The effects of disturbance frequency may be easier to detect in giant kelp because it is fast growing and relatively short lived, with cycles of disturbance and recovery occurring on time scales of years. Much longer data sets (decades to evaluate the role of disturbance relative to other centuries) will likely be needed to properly processes in determining patterns of NPP in other systems.},

Novel ecosystems (also termed 'emerging ecosystems') result when species occur in combinations and relative abundances that have not occurred previously within a given biome. Key characteristics are novelty, in the form of new species combinations and the potential for changes in ecosystem functioning, and human agency, in that these ecosystems are the result of deliberate or inadvertent human action. As more of the Earth becomes transformed by human actions, novel ecosystems increase in importance, but are relatively little studied. Either the degradation or invasion of native or 'wild' ecosystems or the abandonment of intensively managed systems can result in the formation of these novel systems. Important considerations are whether these new systems are persistent and what values they may have. It is likely that it may be very difficult or costly to return such systems to their previous state, and hence consideration needs to be given to developing appropriate management goals and approaches.},

abstract = {A close relationship between adult abundance and stock productivity may not exist for many marine fish stocks, resulting in concern that the management goal of maximum sustainable yield is either inefficient or risky. Although reproductive success is tightly coupled with adult abundance and fecundity in many terrestrial animals, in exploited marine fish where and when fish spawn and consequent dispersal dynamics may have a greater impact. Here, we propose an eco-evolutionary perspective, reproductive resilience, to understand connectivity and productivity in marine fish. Reproductive resilience is the capacity of a population to maintain the reproductive success needed to result in long-term population stability despite disturbances. A stock's reproductive resilience is driven by the underlying traits in its spawner-recruit system, selected for over evolutionary timescales, and the ecological context within which it is operating. Spawner-recruit systems are species specific, have both density-dependent and fitness feedback loops and are made up of fixed, behavioural and ecologically variable traits. They operate over multiple temporal, spatial and biological scales, with trait diversity affecting reproductive resilience at both the population and individual (i.e. portfolio) scales. Models of spawner-recruit systems fall within three categories: (i) two-dimensional models (i.e. spawner and recruit); (ii) process-based biophysical dispersal models which integrate physical and environmental processes into understanding recruitment; and (iii) complex spatially explicit integrated life cycle models. We review these models and their underlying assumptions about reproductive success vs. our emerging mechanistic understanding. We conclude with practical guidelines for integrating reproductive resilience into assessments of population connectivity and stock productivity.},

abstract = {The existence of individual prey specializations has been reported for an ever-growing number of taxa, and has important ramifications for our understanding of predator-prey dynamics. We use the California sea otter population as a case study to validate the use of archival time-depth data to detect and measure differences in foraging behaviour and diet. We collected observational foraging data from radio-tagged sea otters that had been equipped with Mk9 time depth recorders (TDRs, Wildlife Computers, Redmond, WA). After recapturing the study animals and retrieving the TDRs it was possible to compare the two data types, by matching individual dives from the TDR record with observational data and thus examining behavioural correlates of capture success and prey species. Individuals varied with respect to prey selection, aggregating into one of three distinct dietary specializations. A number of TDR-derived parameters, particularly dive depth and post-dive surface interval, differed predictably between specialist types. A combination of six dive parameters was particularly useful for discriminating between specialist types, and when incorporated into a multivariate cluster analysis, these six parameters resulted in classification of 13 adult female sea otters into three clusters that corresponded almost perfectly to the diet-based classification (1 out of 13 animals was misclassified). Thus based solely on quantifiable traits of time-depth data that have been collected over an appropriate period (in this case 1 year per animal), it was possible to assign female sea otters to diet type with {\textgreater}90{\%} accuracy. TDR data can thus be used as a tool to measure the degree of individual specialization in sea otter populations, a conclusion that will likely apply to other diving marine vertebrates as well. Our ultimate goals must be both to understand the causes of individual specialization, and to incorporate such variation into models of population- and community-level food web dynamics. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Mumby2013,
abstract = {Synthesis Coral reefs are widely thought to exhibit multiple attractors which have profound implications for people that depend on them. If reefs become ‘stuck' within a self-reinforcing state dominated by seaweed, it becomes disproportionately difficult and expensive for managers to shift the system back towards its natural, productive, coral state. The existence of multiple attractors is controversial. We assess various forms of evidence and conclude that there remains no incontrovertible proof of multiple attractors on reefs. However, the most compelling evidence, which combines ecological models and field data, is far more consistent with multiple attractors than the competing hypothesis of only a single, coral attractor. Managers should exercise caution and assume that degraded reefs can become stuck there. Testing for the existence of alternate attractors in ecosystems that possess slow dynamics and frequent pulse perturbation is exceptionally challenging. Coral reefs typify such conditions and the existence of alternate attractors is controversial. We analyse different forms of evidence and assess whether they support or challenge the existence of multiple attractors on Caribbean reefs, many of which have shown profound phase shifts in community structure from coral to algal dominance. Field studies alone provide no insight into multiple attractors because the non-equilibrial nature of reef dynamics prevents equilibria from being observed. Statistical models risk failing to sample the parameter space in which multiple attractors occur, and have failed to account for the confounding effects of heterogeneous environments, anthropogenic drivers (e.g. fishing), and major disturbances (e.g. hurricanes). Simple and complex models all find multiple attractors over some – though not all – regions of a system driver (fishing). Tests of model predictions with field data closely match theory of alternate attractors but a forward-leaning monotonic curve with only a single attractor can also be fitted to these data. Deeper consideration of the assumptions of this monotonic relationship reveal significant ecological problems which disappear under a model of multiple attractors. To date, there is no evidence against the existence of multiple attractors on Caribbean reefs and while there remains no definitive proof, the balance of evidence and ecological reasoning favours their existence. Theory predicts that Caribbean reefs do not exhibit alternate attractors in their natural state but that disease-induced loss of two key functional groups has generated bistability. Whether alternate attractors becomes a persistent element of reef dynamics or a brief moment in their geological history will depend, in part, on the ability of functional groups to recover and the impacts of climate change and ocean acidification on coral growth and mortality.},

abstract = {Wide-scale and sudden shifts in several biological and environmental systems of NW Europe have been reported in recent years, and attributed to a range of factors, both climatic and anthropogenic. To examine whether there is any evidence of coinciding region-wide environmental shifts, we gathered existing long-term data series on a wide range of physical and biological parameters from the 1960s to the present and, following the methods of a similar recent study on North Pacific regime shifts, we analysed the data using principal component analysis and regime shift analysis to identify the extent and timing of regime shifts in NW Europe. The end-point of a regime (i.e. the year) was determined using a sliding window in regime shift analysis. Additionally we applied chronological clustering to the (1) combined data, (2) biological data and (3) environmental data. In all 3 cases, the same regimes were identified. Our results indicate that substantial regime shifts occurred in the marine ecosystem in 1979 and 1988 and perhaps also in 1998, although results were less clear-cut in the latter case. These regime shifts were most evident among the biological data series, but they appeared to have been triggered by earlier shifts in a number of environmental factors. Salinity and weather conditions played an important role in the 1979 shift, while in the 1988 shift, temperature and weather conditions were the predominant factors. Our results confirm those of the North Pacific study, with concomitant changes in physical and biological indices. This indicates a shift in climate-ocean interactions throughout the entire temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere.},

abstract = {We compared selection of northern Yellowstone elk (Cervus elaphus) by hunters in the Gardiner Late Hunt and northern Yellowstone wolves (Canis lupus) with regard to sex, age, and impacts to recruitment. We compared harvest data from 1996-2001 with wolf-killed elk data from 1995-2001. We assessed the effects of hunting and wolf predation on reproductive female elk by constructing a life table and calculating reproductive values for females in the northern Yellowstone herd. We devised an index of total reproductive impact to measure impacts to calf production due to hunting and wolf predation. The age classes of female elk selected by wolves and hunters were significantly different. Hunters selected a large proportion of female elk with the greatest reproductive values, whereas wolves selected a large proportion of elk calves and older females with low reproductive values. The mean age of adult females killed by hunters throughout the study period was 6.5 years, whereas the mean age of adult females killed by wolves was 13.9 years. Hunting exerted a greater total reproductive impact on the herd than wolf predation. The combined effects of hunters killing prime-aged females (2-9 yr old), wolves killing calves, and predation by other predators has the potential to limit the elk population in the future. Yellowstone is unique in this regard because multiple predators that occur sympatrically, including hunters, wolves, grizzly bears (Ursus arctos), black bears (Ursus americanus), cougars (Felis concolor), and coyotes (Canis latrans), all prey on elk. Using an Adaptive Harvest Management process the known female elk harvest during the Gardiner Late Hunt has been reduced by 72{\%} from 2,221 elk in 1997 to 620 elk in 2004. In the future, hunting harvest levels may be reduced further to partially offset elk losses to wolves, other predators, and environmental factors.},

Four types of model are identified: descriptive multispecies, dynamic multispecies, aggregate system, and dynamic system models. The strengths and weaknesses of multispecies models and their ability to evaluate the causal mechanisms underlying shifts in production are examined. This comparison provides a basis for assessing the benefits of each modelling approach as a tool for evaluating impacts of fishing in marine ecosystems. Benefits of multispecies models include: improved estimates of natural mortality and recruitment; better understanding of spawner{\^{a}}€“recruit relationships and of variability in growth rates; alternative views on biological reference points; and a framework for evaluating ecosystem properties. Populations are regulated by competition (food limitation), predation, and environmental variability. Each factor may influence different life-history stages, locally or regionally. However, most multispecies models address only a subset of these factors, often aggregated over functionally different species or age groups. Models that incorporate the important interactions at specific stages and scales will be necessary if they are to continue to supplement the information provided by single-species models.},

abstract = {Abstract: Recovery criteria for depleted species or populations normally are based on demographic measures, the goal being to maintain enough individuals over a sufficiently large area to assure a socially tolerable risk of future extinction. Such demographically based recovery criteria may be insufficient to restore the functional roles of strongly interacting species. We explored the idea of developing a recovery criterion for sea otters (Enhydra lutris) in the Aleutian archipelago on the basis of their keystone role in kelp forest ecosystems. We surveyed sea otters and rocky reef habitats at 34 island-time combinations. The system nearly always existed in either a kelp-dominated or deforested phase state, which was predictable from sea otter density. We used a resampling analysis of these data to show that the phase state at any particular island can be determined at 95{\%} probability of correct classification with information from as few as six sites. When sea otter population status (and thus the phase state of the kelp forest) was allowed to vary randomly among islands, just 15 islands had to be sampled to estimate the true proportion that were kelp dominated (within 10{\%}) with 90{\%} confidence. We conclude that kelp forest phase state is a more appropriate, sensitive, and cost-effective measure of sea otter recovery than the more traditional demographically based metrics, and we suggest that similar approaches have broad potential utility in establishing recovery criteria for depleted populations of other functionally important species.},

abstract = {Determining the relative importance of local and regional processes for the distribution of population abundance is a fundamental but contentious issue in ecology. In marine systems, classical theory holds that the influence of demographic processes and dispersal is confined to local populations whereas the environment controls regional patterns of abundance. Here, we use spatial synchrony to compare the distribution of population abundance of the dominant mussel Mytilus californianus observed along the West Coast of the United States to that predicted by dynamical models undergoing different dispersal and environmental treatments to infer the relative influence of local and regional processes. We reveal synchronized fluctuations in the abundance of mussel populations across a whole continent despite limited larval dispersal and strong environmental forcing. We show that dispersal among neighboring populations interacts with local demographic processes to generate characteristic patterns of spatial synchrony that can govern the dynamic distribution of mussel abundance over 1,800 km of coastline. Our study emphasizes the importance of dispersal and local dynamics for the distribution of abundance at the continental scale. It further highlights potential limits to the use of "climate envelope" models for predicting the response of large-scale ecosystems to global climate change.},

abstract = {Two ecological paradigms, the trophic cascade and the host-density threshold in disease, interact in the kelp-forest ecosystem to structure the community. To investigate what happens when a trophic cascade pushes a host population over a host-threshold density, I analyzed a 10-year data set of kelp forest communities at 16 sites in the region of the Channel Islands National Park, CA, USA. Historically, lobsters, and perhaps other predators, kept urchin populations at low levels and kelp forests developed a community-level trphic cascade. In geographic areas where the main predators on urchins were fished, urchin populations increased to the extent that they overgrazed algage and starvation eventually limited urchin-population growth. Despite the limitation of urchin population size by food availability, urchin densities, at times, well exceeded the host-density threshold for epidemics. An urchin-specific bacterial disease entered the region after 1992 and acted as a density dependent mortality source. Dense populations were more likely to experience epidemics and suffer higher mortality. Disease did not reduce the urchin population at a site to the density that prediators previously did. Therefore, disease did not fully replace predators in the trophic cascade. These results indicate how fishing top predators can indirectly favor disease transmission in prey populations.},

Recovery of M. pyrifera populations from decreased adult density was a 2-stage process requiring the establishment of juvenile populations and conditions suitable for juvenile growth to adult size. Sporophyte recruitment was negatively correlated with M. pyrifera canopy cover, and thus appeared to be related to irradiance. Distinct patterns in sporophyte recruitment resulted in continuous juvenile populations at the protected site and intermittent juvenile populations at the intermediate and exposed sites. Episodic sporophyte recruitment at the intermediate and exposed sites resulted in decreased coincidence of the two recovery stages.},

Alternatively, dynamic survey designs explicitly incorporate knowledge of ecological processes, the associated uncertainty in those processes, and can be optimized with respect to monitoring objectives. We describe a cohesive framework for monitoring a spreading population that explicitly links animal movement models with survey design and monitoring objectives. We apply the framework to develop an optimal survey design for sea otters in Glacier Bay. Sea otters were first detected in Glacier Bay in 1988 and have since increased in both abundance and distribution; abundance estimates increased from 5 otters to {\textgreater}5,000 otters, and they have spread faster than 2.7 km per year. By explicitly linking animal movement models and survey design, we were able to reduce uncertainty associated with predicted occupancy, abundance, and distribution.

abstract = {Giant kelp [Macrocystis pyrifera (Linnaeus) C. Agardh] forests are commonly called a community, but their composition varies among sites and depths. While numerous studies mention this variation and it is the descriptive basis for general models of kelp community structure, it has rarely been quantitatively assessed. We described kelp forest structure among four depths (6, 9, 12, and 15 m) at nine sites along 80 km of the relatively pristine Big Sur coast of California. Density and cover of common organisms were assessed in replicate quadrats at each depth in each site. Macrocystis pyrifera formed a surface canopy at eight sites, and bull kelp, Nereocystis luetkeana (Mertens) Postels {\&} Ruprecht, at one site. The understory kelps Pterygophora californica Ruprecht and Laminaria setchellii P.C. Silva and the bat star Asterina miniata Brandt were the most abundant organisms counted as individuals. Geniculate and nongeniculate coralline algae and encrusting invertebrates had the highest cover. Abundances of giant kelp and the two understory kelps, and sessile invertebrates were significantly different among sites, and differences in sessile invertebrate abundance suggest two general 'types' of kelp forests in the region; one with abundant understory kelps and coralline algae and the other with an understory dominated by sessile invertebrates. Among the eight abundant taxa only the abundance of the two types of coralline algae varied significantly among depths when all sites were combined. Cluster analyses indicated two depth zones within these forests. ?? 2001 Adac/??ditions scientifiques et m??dicales Elsevier SAS.},

abstract = {We present a quantitative synthesis of trophic cascades in terrestrial systems using data from 41 studies, reporting 60 independent tests. The studies covered a wide range of taxa in various terrestrial systems with varying degrees of species diversity. We quantified the average magnitude of direct effects of carnivores on herbivore prey and indirect effects of carnivores on plants. We examined how the effect magnitudes varied with type of carnivores in the study system, food web diversity, and experimental protocol. A metaanalysis of the data revealed that trophic cascades were common among the studies. Exceptions to this general trend did arise. In some cases, trophic cascades were expected not to occur, and they did not. In other cases, the direct effects of carnivores on herbivores were stronger than the indirect effects of carnivores on plants, indicating that top-down effects attenuated. Top-down effects usually attenuated whenever plants contained antiherbivore defenses or when herbivore species diversity was high. Conclusions about the strength of top-down effects of carnivores varied with the type of carnivore and with the plant-response variable measured. Vertebrate carnivores generally had stronger effects than invertebrate carnivores. Carnivores, in general, had stronger effects when the response was measured as plant damage rather than as plant biomass or plant reproductive output. We caution, therefore, that conclusions about the strength of top-down effects could be an artifact of the plant-response variable measured. We also found that mesocosm experiments generally had weaker effect magnitudes than open-plot field experiments or observational experiments. Trophic cascades in terrestrial systems, although not a universal phenomenon, are a consistent response throughout the published studies reviewed here. Our analysis thus suggests that they occur more frequently in terrestrial systems than currently believed. Moreover, the mechanisms and strengths of top-down effects of carnivores are equivalent to those found in other types of systems (e.g., aquatic environments).},

To do EBFM, one of the key tools will be to use ecosystem models. To fully use ecosystem models and have their outputs adopted, there is an increasingly recognized need to address uncertainty associated with such modeling activities. Here we characterize uncertainty as applied to ecosystem models into six major factors, including: natural variability; observation error; inadequate communication among scientists, decision-makers and stakeholders; the structural complexity of the model(s) used; outcome uncertainty; and unclear management objectives. We then describe best practices to address each of these uncertainties as they particularly apply to ecosystem models being used in a LMR management context. We also present case studies to highlight examples of how these best practices have been implemented. Although we acknowledge that this work was compiled by ecosystem modelers in an LMR management context primarily for other ecosystem modelers, the principles and practices described herein are also germane for managers, stakeholders and other natural resource management communities. We conclude by emphasizing not only the need to address uncertainty in ecosystem models, but also the feasibility and benefits of doing so. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {Many marine ecosystems exhibit a characteristic "wasp-waist" structure, where a single species, or at most several species, of small planktivorous fishes entirely dominate their trophic level. These species have complex life histories that result in radical variability that may propagate to both higher and lower trophic levels of the ecosystem. In addition, these populations have two key attributes: (1) they represent the lowest trophic level that is mobile, so they are capable of relocating their area of operation according to their own internal dynamics; (2) they may prey upon the early life stages of their predators, forming an unstable feedback loop in the trophic system that may, for example, precipitate abrupt regime shifts. Experience with the typical "boom-bust" dynamics of this type of population, and with populations that interact trophically with them, suggests a "predator pit" type of dynamics. This features a refuge from predation when abundance is very low, very destructive predation between an abundance level sufficient to attract interest from predators and an abundance level sufficient to satiate available predators, and, as abundance increases beyond this satiation point, decreasing specific predation mortality and population breakout. A simple formalism is developed to describe these dynamics. Examples of its application include (a) a hypothetical mechanism for progressive geographical habitat expansion at high biomass, (b) an explanation for the out-of-phase alternations of abundances of anchovies and sardines in many regional systems that appear to occur without substantial adverse interactions between the two species groups, and (c) an account of an interaction of environmental processes and fishery exploitation that caused a regime shift. The last is the example of the Baltic Sea, where the cod resource collapsed in concert with establishment of dominance of that ecosystem by the cod's 'wasp-waist" prey, herring and sprat. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Overfishing has caused dramatic changes in structures of exploited populations as well as ecosystems. In this article, we focus on fishing effects on age (size) and spatial structures of exploited fishes. Accumulating evidence has shown that large and experienced spawning individuals are able to produce higher quality and quantity of eggs, known as maternal effects, and that individuals of different age classes tend to spawn in different locations and times. These behaviors are associated with a healthy age structure and contribute to bet-hedging capacity that is important in smoothing out short-term environmental variability. Here, we document a widespread phenomenon of age (size)-truncation of exploited populations driven by size-selective fishery removals. Such size-selective fishing may have evolutionary consequence and may be difficult to reverse. In addition, fishing often reduces population spatial heterogeneity that also contributes importantly to bet-hedging. We review studies showing that the effects of age truncation and reduction of spatial heterogeneity have reduced resilience and elevated the fluctuation amplitude of exploited populations facing a changing environment. Recent analyses indicated that fish populations often exhibit nonlinear nature and have potential to shift dramatically in a short time. All the evidence suggests that fishing, by altering age or spatial structures, may make exploited fishes, more prone to catastrophic shifts. Therefore, to achieve sustainable fisheries, management should conserve the age and spatial structure in addition to viable spawning biomass.},

For this comparative study, we use the 50-year larval fish time series from the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations, which allows us to view fishing as a treatment effect in a long-term ecological experiment. Our results indicate that exploited species show a clearer distributional shift in response to environmental change than unexploited species, even after accounting for life history and ecological traits and phylogeny. The enhanced response (improved signal–noise ratio) to environmental change in exploited species may be a consequence of reduced spatial heterogeneity caused by fishery-induced age (size) truncation and the constriction of geographic distribution that accompanies fishing pressure. We suggest that reduced spatial heterogeneity can cause exploited populations to be more vulnerable to climate variability, an effect that could have considerable importance in the management of fish stocks. This is the first study to compare the geographic distributions of a large suite of exploited and unexploited fish species from the northeastern Pacific in response to climate variability.},

abstract = {Once numbering perhaps 300,000 throughout nearshore habitats around the Pacific Rim, sea otters were exploited in a 170-year commercial fur harvest that ended early in the twentieth century. Although the average annual harvest was less than about 1.5{\%}, a process of serial depletion resulted in extirpation throughout nearly their entire historic range. By late in the nineteenth century fewer than 2000 animals remained in 13 isolated areas. Subsequent conservation efforts including protection from harvest and translocations resulted in eventual recovery of the species, although large gaps in distribution remain today along western North America, south of Alaska. Currently, about 125,000 individuals occupy their truncated range and most sea otter populations being monitored are experiencing growth rates that are less than rates observed a few decades ago. Despite large tracts of unoccupied habitat there has been little recent change in the overall abundance of sea otters. Behavior and physiology appear to constrain the sea otter to small individual home ranges and result in population structuring at relatively small scales. Varying population trajectories over spatial scales on the order of hundreds of square kilometers or less imply differences in demographic rates at these same scales. Effective conservation will benefit from consideration of those biological attributes specific to individual species that collectively result in unique population structuring properties.},

abstract = {The timing and extent of the negative population trend in the abundance of the western stock of Steller sea lions has not been geographically uniform. A stochastic metapopulation dynamics model is developed for Steller sea lions. This model allows for geographical differences in factors affecting population processes, and can be parameterized to represent a wide range of hypotheses for the decline in Steller sea lion abundance. Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods are used to fit this model to pup and non-pup count data, age structure samples, and survival estimates. Inferences from model selection criteria highlight the spatial variability in the types of impact deemed to provide most parsimonious representation of the data. Bayesian posteriors for the estimated model parameters show that many combinations of parameter values are able to provide similar fits to the data, even given a specific hypothesis for the decline. This highlights the uncertainty in the precise nature of the impact of these hypotheses. Indeed, while pup production is generally estimated consistently among models, estimates of the size of other com- ponents of the Steller sea lion population (such as total population size) depend greatly on the assumptions regarding the cause of the decline. The results demonstrate that future simulation modeling approaches will require more formal, spatial, and mechanistic descriptions of the manner in which specific hypotheses for the decline affect the population.},

abstract = {Surplus production rates predicted by simple biomass dynamics models are generally 23 expected to follow a simple dome-shaped pattern as population size changes, and to show 24 similar trajectories during population decline and recovery. Age-structured models, 25 however, predict substantially lower surplus production rates during population recovery 26 than during decline due to reduced mean fecundity, unless recruitment compensation is 27 very strong. Ecosystem models like Ecosim predict more complex patterns, with reduced 28 production during recoveries due to both age-structure effects and cultivation- 29 depensation effects related to changes in competitor and predator abundances. 30 Production-driven recoveries, where surplus production per biomass is higher during 31 recovery than decline, are predicted in cases where there has been substantial change in 32 overall ecosystem productivity or community structure. 110 case examples illustrate that 33 simple, repeatable relationships between stock size and production are uncommon, and 34 the most common pattern is production-driven change in stock size, where changes in 35 production rate apparently independent of stock size then drive stock increase or 36 decrease. We conclude that non-stationarity in productivity needs to be considered as 37 part of population rebuilding, and that empirical estimates of surplus production may 38 provide insight in this process.},

The unified neutral theory of biodiversity and related theories based on these fundamental population processes have successfully recreated general species-abundance patterns without accounting for either the variation among species and individuals or resource-releasing processes such as predation and disturbance, long emphasized in ecological theory. If ecological communities can be described adequately without estimating variation in species and their interactions, our understanding of ecological community organization and the predicted consequences of reduced biodiversity and environmental change would shift markedly. Here, I introduce a strong method to test the neutral theory that combines field parameterization of the underlying population dynamics with a field experiment, and apply it to a rocky intertidal community. Although the observed abundance-frequency distribution of the system follows that predicted by the neutral theory, the neutral theory predicts poorly the field experimental results, indicating an essential role for variation in species interactions.},

abstract = {The 1995/1996 reintroduction of gray wolves (Canis lupus) into Yellowstone National Park after a 70. year absence has allowed for studies of tri-trophic cascades involving wolves, elk (Cervus elaphus), and plant species such as aspen (Populus tremuloides), cottonwoods (Populus spp.), and willows (Salix spp.). To investigate the status of this cascade, in September of 2010 we repeated an earlier survey of aspen and measured browsing and heights of young aspen in 97 stands along four streams in the Lamar River catchment of the park's northern winter range. We found that browsing on the five tallest young aspen in each stand decreased from 100{\%} of all measured leaders in 1998 to means of {\textless}25{\%} in the uplands and {\textless}20{\%} in riparian areas by 2010. Correspondingly, aspen recruitment (i.e., growth of seedlings/sprouts above the browse level of ungulates) increased as browsing decreased over time in these same stands. We repeated earlier inventories of cottonwoods and found that recruitment had also increased in recent years. We also synthesized studies on trophic cascades published during the first 15. years after wolf reintroduction. Synthesis results generally indicate that the reintroduction of wolves restored a trophic cascade with woody browse species growing taller and canopy cover increasing in some, but not all places. After wolf reintroduction, elk populations decreased, but both beaver (Caster canadensis) and bison (Bison bison) numbers increased, possibly due to the increase in available woody plants and herbaceous forage resulting from less competition with elk. Trophic cascades research during the first 15. years after wolf reintroduction indicated substantial initial effects on both plants and animals, but northern Yellowstone still appears to be in the early stages of ecosystem recovery. In ecosystems where wolves have been displaced or locally extirpated, their reintroduction may represent a particularly effective approach for passive restoration. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Chlorophyll concentration, phytoplankton biomass, and total and nitrate-fueled primary productivity increase toward the coast over the 12-km-wide continental shelf of the southern portion of the Southern California Bight. These gradients are accompanied by changes in phytoplankton community composition: the outer shelf is characterized by offshore assemblages including pelagophytes and oligotrophic Synechococcus ecotypes while the inner shelf is dominated by diatoms, coastal Synechococcus ecotypes, and the picoeukaryote Ostreococcus. Across the small horizontal scale of the shelf, large changes in the vertical distribution and flux of nitrate maintain elevated productivity, driving variability in the vertical distribution of biomass and the integrated biomass and productivity of the entire shelf. Temporal variability from hours to days in chlorophyll fluorescence as measured by an autonomous profiling vehicle demonstrates that phytoplankton respond vigorously and rapidly to physical variability. The interaction of physical processes at different temporal and spatial scales is responsible for the observed biological gradients. These dynamics include: (1) vertical shear in the alongshore currents, (2) local wind forcing, (3) the internal tide, and (4) remote, large-scale variability. Individually, these mechanisms rarely or never explain the phytoplankton community composition and metabolic rate gradients. These results and a reanalysis of historical data suggest that monitoring thermal stratification at the shelf break and the tilt of the thermocline across the shelf will augment our ability to predict phytoplankton productivity, community composition, and biomass, thereby improving our understanding of fisheries dynamics and carbon cycling in the coastal ocean.},

Although this practice may have negative effects on biodiversity and populations of individual species, it may also increase total fishery productivity by removing predatory fish. We examine the potential for this phenomenon to explain the high reported wild catches in the East China Sea - one of the most productive ecosystems in the world that has also had its catch reporting accuracy and fishery management questioned. We show that reported catches can be approximated using an ecosystem model that allows for trophic cascades (i.e., the depletion of predators and consequent increases in production of their prey). This would be the world's largest known example of marine ecosystem "engineering" and suggests that trade-offs between conservation and food production exist. We project that fishing practices could be modified to increase total catches, revenue, and biomass in the East China Sea, but single-species management would decrease both catches and revenue by reversing the trophic cascades. Our results suggest that implementing single-species management in currently lightly managed and highly exploited multispecies fisheries (which account for a large fraction of global fish catch) may result in decreases in global catch. Efforts to reform management in these fisheries will need to consider system wide impacts of changes in management, rather than focusing only on individual species.},

abstract = {1. Numerous studies have shown that, at spatial scales of metres to several kilometres, ani-mals balance the trade-off between foraging success and predation mortality by increasing their use of safer but less profitable habitats as predation risk increases. However, it is less clear whether prey respond similarly at the larger spatiotemporal scales of many ecosystems. 2. We determine whether this behaviour is evident in a large marine ecosystem, the southernGulf of St. Lawrence (sGSL, 75 000 km2 ) over a 42-year period. This ecosystem is character-ized by a recent increase in the abundance of a large marine predator, the grey seal ( Halichoe-rus grypus Fabricius), by more than an order of magnitude. 3.We compared changes in spatial distribution over the 1971– 2012 period between important prey of grey seals (Atlantic cod,Gadus morhuaL.; white hake,Urophycis tenuis Mitchill; and thorny skate,Amblyraja radiata Donovan) and non-prey fishes. Distribution was modelled using generalized additive models incorporating spatially variable effects of predation risk, density dependence and water temperature. 4. Distributions of cod, hake and skate were strongly related to risk of predation by seals, with distribution shifting into lower risk areas as predation risk increased. Non-prey species did not show similar changes in habitat use. Spatial variation in fish condition suggests that these low-risk areas are also less profitable for cod and skate in terms of food availability. The effects of density dependence and water temperature were also important in models, but did not account for the changes in habitat use as the risk of predation increased. 5. These results indicate that these fish are able to assess and respond to spatial variation in predation risk at very large spatial scales. They also suggest that non-consumptive ‘risk' effects may be an important component of the declines in productivity of seal prey in this ecosystem, and of the indirect effects at lower trophic levels.},

abstract = {Throughout the 1990s, the Gulf of St. Lawrence snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) harvest provided an example of effective co-management in a developing fishery. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) and the snow crab fleet (the fleet) shared information that coordinated management and exploitation throughout the season. A preseason survey by DFO provided resource distributions prior to the fishery's opening. In-season monitoring allowed managers to track spatial and temporal variation in crab availability. This level of detail allowed the application of the ideal free distribution as a management and conservation tool. However, proper justification for its application requires the demonstration of information exchange and competitive effects. The spatial distribution of effort suggests that both of these are present. Fishing effort was influenced by public information and potential information exchange within the fleet. Reduced aggregation at smaller spatial scales suggests competition in trap placement. Thus, increasing fleet size may have a disproportionately small impact on fishing mortality because of limitations in information exchange and the lack of personal information in the new vessels. However, the nonlinear relationship between crab abundance and catch rates suggests that managers should avoid policies that increase fishing effort during times of low crab abundance.},

abstract = {Numerous groundfish stocks in both the Atlantic and Pacific are considered overfished, resulting in large-scale fishery closures. Fishing, in addition to simply removing biomass, also truncates the age and size structure of fish populations and often results in localized depletions. We summarize recent research suggesting that an old-growth age structure, combined with a broad spatial distribution of spawning and recruitment, is at least as important as spawning biomass in maintaining long-term sustainable population levels. In particular, there is evidence that older, larger female rockfishes produce larvae that with- stand starvation longer and grow faster than the offspring of younger fish, that stocks may actually consist of several reproductively isolated units, and that recruitment may come from only a small and different fraction of the spawning population each year. None of these phenomena is accounted for in current management programs. We examine alter- native management measures that address these specific issues and conclude that the best and perhaps only way to ensure old-growth age structure and complex spatial structure in populations of groundfish is through interconnected networks of marine reserves},

abstract = {The benefits provided by a healthy ocean are receiving increasing attention in policy and management spheres. A fundamental challenge with assessing ocean health and ecosystem services is that we lack a scientific framework for expressing ecosystem conditions quantitatively in relation to management goals. Here we outline and operationalize a conceptual framework for identifying meaningful reference points and quantifying the current ecosystem state relative to them. The framework requires clear articulation of management goals and is built on a review of current scientific understanding and assessment of data availability. It develops a structured approach for choosing among three classes of reference points, including: (1) functional relationships that establish the ocean state that can be produced and sustained under different environmental conditions, (2) time series approaches that compare current to previous capacities to obtain a particular ocean state in a specific location, and (3) spatial reference points that compare current capacities to achieve a desired ocean state across regional (or, if necessary, global) scales. We illustrate this general framework through the lens of ocean health defined in terms of a coupled social-ecological system, with examples from fisheries, marine livelihoods, and water quality in the USA. Assessment of ocean health and ecosystem services can be significantly influenced by the choice of indicators used to track changes in a management goal, the type of reference point selected, and how one measures the distance of the current state from the reference point. This framework provides flexible, standardized methods for evaluating ocean health and ecosystem services that can advance important components of ecosystem-based management, including marine spatial planning, ecosystem service valuation, and integrated ecosystem assessments},

abstract = {Some of the most profound effects of climate change on ecological communities are due to alterations in species interactions rather than direct physiological effects of changing environmental con-ditions. Empirical evidence of historical changes in species inter-actions within climate-impacted communities is, however, rare and difficult to obtain. Here, we demonstrate the recent disappearance of key habitat-forming kelp forests from a warming tropical–tem-perate transition zone in eastern Australia. Using a 10-y video data-set encompassing a 0.6 °C warming period, we show how herbivory increased as kelp gradually declined and then disappeared. Concur-rently, fish communities from sites where kelp was originally abun-dant but subsequently disappeared became increasingly dominated by tropical herbivores. Feeding assays identified two key tropical/ subtropical herbivores that consumed transplanted kelp within hours at these sites. There was also a distinct increase in the abun-dance of fishes that consume epilithic algae, and much higher bite rates by this group at sites without kelp, suggesting a key role for these fishes in maintaining reefs in kelp-free states by removing kelp recruits. Changes in kelp abundance showed no direct relation-ship to seawater temperatures over the decade and were also un-related to other measured abiotic factors (nutrients and storms). Our results show that warming-mediated increases in fish herbivory pose a significant threat to kelp-dominated ecosystems in Australia and, potentially, globally. climate change | macroalgae | plant–herbivore interactions | range shifts |},

Snow crab abundance is highly variable, but the causes of large changes in year-class strength are poorly known. We used a regression approach to examine the effects of snow crab spawning stock biomass, bottom water temperature, cold area or sea ice extent, and predation by Pacific cod Gadus macrocephalus or Atlantic cod G. morhua on snow crab recruitment in each of 3 ecosystems: the eastern Bering Sea, the Newfoundland-Labrador Shelf, and the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence. Comparing results across systems showed that cold ocean conditions during early life history were associated with increased snow crab recruitment or recruitment indices in all 3 ecosystems. However, we found no consistent evidence that spawning stock or gadid biomasses were significantly related to subsequent snow crab recruitment. Our results underscore the value of comparing multiple ecosystems and demonstrate the importance of ocean conditions in driving variability in snow crab populations. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research and Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2012.},

abstract = {Recent discussions on scaling issues in ecology have emphasized that processes acting at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales influence ecosystems and thus there is no appropriate single scale at which ecological processes should be studied. This may be particularly true for environmental disturbances (e.g. El Ni{\~{n}}o) that occur over large geographic areas and encompass a wide range of scales relevant to ecosystem function. However, it may be possible to identify the scale(s) at which ecosystems are most strongly impacted by disturbances, and thus provide a measure by which their impacts can be most clearly described, by assessing scale-dependent changes in the patterns of variability in species abundance and distribution. This, in turn, may yield significant insight into the relative importance of the various forcing factors responsible for generating these impacts. The 1997-98 El Ni{\~{n}}o was one of the strongest El Ni{\~{n}}os ever recorded. I examined how this event impacted giant kelp populations in the northeast Pacific Ocean at 90 sites ranging from central Baja California, Mexico to central California, USA. These sites spanned the geographic range of giant kelp in the Northeast Pacific and were surveyed just before, immediately following, several months after, more than 1 year after, and nearly 2 years after the El Ni{\~{n}}o. I used a hierarchical sample design to compare these impacts at five spatial scales spanning six orders of magnitude, from a few meters to more than 1,000 km. Variance Components Analyses revealed that the El Ni{\~{n}}o shifted control over giant kelp abundance from factors acting at the scale of a few meters (local control) to factors operating over hundreds to thousands of kilometers (regional control). Moreover, El Ni{\~{n}}o resulted in the near-complete loss of all giant kelp throughout one-half of the species' range in the northeast Pacific Ocean. Giant kelp recovery following El Ni{\~{n}}o was far more complex and variable at multiple spatial scales, presumably driven by numerous factors acting at those scales. Recovery returned local control of giant kelp populations within 6 months in southern California, and within 2 years in Baja California.},

abstract = {Subtidal forests comprised of kelps and other canopy-forming macroalgae represent critically important marine habitats. Kelp forests exhibit high rates of primary productivity, magnified secondary productivity, support high levels of biodiversity and provide various ecosystem services. Compared with many other regions, kelp forests around the UK have been largely understudied despite their recognised importance and the possible impacts of environmental change factors. We conducted surveys at 12 kelp-dominated open-coast sites within four regions in the UK, spanning {\~{}} 9° in latitude and {\~{}} 3 °C in mean sea temperature. We used a combination of quadrat-scale abundance and percent cover data as well as transect-scale canopy cover estimates to quantify ecological structure at multiple spatial scales. Kelp forest structure varied significantly between sites (nested within region) and also between regions. Regional-scale differences were principally driven by a higher abundance/cover of Alaria esculenta at the colder northern regions (i.e. north and west Scotland), and the presence of the Lusitanian kelp Laminaria ochroleuca at some sites in the southernmost region (i.e. southwest England) but nowhere else. The kelp Laminaria hyperborea dominated all sites and varied significantly between sites but not regions. All assemblage-level and population-level response variables were highly variable between sites within regions, suggesting that environmental factors varying at corresponding spatial scales (e.g. wave exposure, turbidity, sedimentation) are important drivers of pattern. The detection of regional-scale variability suggests that predicted changes in ocean climate, particularly increased sea temperature, may lead to changes in kelp forest structure in the future, with poleward range contractions (for A. esculenta) and expansions (for L. ochroleuca) likely. However, as the distribution-abundance patterns of the assemblage dominant L. hyperborea did not vary predictably with ocean temperature at this spatial scale, the fundamental structure of these habitats may be more influenced by localised factors, at least in the short-term. The relative importance of multiple, concurrent environmental change factors in structuring UK kelp forests remains largely unknown.},

abstract = {After near extinction as a result of the fur trade in the 1700s and 1800s, the southern sea otter slowly reoccupied the core of its range in central California. Range expansion beyond central California is seen as key to full recovery of otters, but the rate of expansion has been sporadic, raising concerns about habitat quality in southern California. To describe the range expansion of sea otters from central into southern California, we used skiff surveys, aerial surveys, and archival time-depth recorders from 2004 to 2013. These observations show that range expansion began when male otters swam southeast of Point Conception (Cojo Anchorage), perhaps to seek refuge from bad weather and to feed on unexploited resources. After several years of seasonal use by male groups, females began to use the area, leading to reproduction and a secondary increase in abundance. In contrast, a second male group that moved farther down the coast to Coal Oil Point stalled and retreated. Such range expansion and contraction can be explained by the social nature of sea otters, which acts to slow dispersal away from groups. Otter densities at Cojo Anchorage are now approaching equilibrium levels reported for central California. As in central California, otters rested in and near kelp forest habitat, but used deeper water for foraging. Together, these observations suggest habitat in the Santa Barbara Channel can still support sea otters, but range expansion of otters into southern California will be episodic due to social dynamics.

In contrast, large urchins (adult S. franciscanus) did not significantly alter grazing in the presence of cues from the sea star and, when immobile, were less frequently attacked by the predator. However, the sea star's preference (active predator choice) was obscured by sea urchin mobility, that is, small S. franciscanus was only most preferred when unable to escape. These results suggest that by identifying the relative threat of predation facing guild members and the degree to which individuals transmit trait-mediated indirect interactions, these indirect effects may be predictably incorporated in community interactions.},

We studied changes related to these "natural experiments" to reveal the mechanisms of regime shifts. Two major shifts were detected, the first related to a depletion of marine predators and the second to an outburst of the alien comb jelly Mnemiopsis leidyi; both shifts were triggered by intense fishing resulting in system-wide trophic cascades. The complex nature of ecosystem responses to human activities calls for more elaborate approaches than currently provided by traditional environmental and fisheries management. This implies challenging existing practices and implementing explanatory models of ecosystem interactions that can better reconcile conservation and ecosystem management ideals.},

abstract = {Current trends in marine ecosystems need to be interpreted against a solid understanding of the magnitude and drivers of past changes. Over the last decade, marine scientists from different disciplines have engaged in the emerging field of marine historical ecology to reconstruct past changes in the sea. Here we review the diversity of approaches used and resulting patterns of historical changes in large marine mammals, birds, reptiles and fish. Across 256 reviewed records, exploited populations declined 89{\%} from historical abundance levels (range: 11-100{\%}). In many cases, long-term fluctuations are related to climate variation, rapid declines to overexploitation and recent recoveries to conservation measures. These emerging historical patterns offer new insights into past ecosystems, and provide important context for contemporary ocean management. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Shelton2011,
abstract = {A central and classic question in ecology is what causes populations to fluctuate in abundance. Understanding the interaction between natural drivers of fluctuating populations and human exploitation is an issue of paramount importance for conservation and natural resource management. Three main hypotheses have been proposed to explain fluctuations: (i) species interactions, such as predator-prey interactions, cause fluctuations, (ii) strongly nonlinear single-species dynamics cause fluctuations, and (iii) environmental variation cause fluctuations. We combine a general fisheries model with data from a global sample of fish species to assess how two of these hypothesis, nonlinear single-species dynamics and environmental variation, interact with human exploitation to affect the variability of fish populations. In contrast with recent analyses that suggest fishing drives increased fluctuations by changing intrinsic nonlinear dynamics, we show that single-species nonlinear dynamics alone, both in the presence and absence of fisheries, are unlikely to drive deterministic fluctuations in fish; nearly all fish populations fall into regions of stable dynamics. However, adding environmental variation dramatically alters the consequences of exploitation on the temporal variability of populations. In a variable environment, (i) the addition of mortality from fishing leads to increased temporal variability for all species examined, (ii) variability in recruitment rates of juveniles contributes substantially more to fluctuations than variation in adult mortality, and (iii) the correlation structure of juvenile and adult vital rates plays an important and underappreciated role in determining population fluctuations. Our results are robust to alternative model formulations and to a range of environmental autocorrelation.},

abstract = {Geographic variation in ecological and environmental factors may lead to intraspecific differences among populations. For the California sheephead (Semicossyphus pulcher), an important predator in kelp forests and a target of commercial and recreational fisheries, we evaluated the degree to which different populations exhibited variation in density, demography, and life history traits. We assessed biogeographic patterns of abundance through underwater visual census at 39 sites spanning a major portion of the species range ( southern California, USA, to Baja California, Mexico) and made collections from seven focal sites to investigate geographic differences in demography and life histories. California sheephead densities were significantly greater in the southern part of their range and at offshore islands than along the mainland coast. At the focal sites, we found significant spatial variation in density, fecundity, size structure, growth rates, annual survivorship, and the timing of maturation and sex change. Density- and temperature-dependent effects helped to explain the intraspecific differences in these parameters. Studies such as this one will allow for demographic plasticity to be incorporated into future stock assessments. Management of temperate reef fishes may best be achieved on smaller spatial scales as we increase our understanding of geographic variation among populations.},

abstract = {Globally, there is increased scientific and public interest in the concept of ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM). This trend is fueled by a widespread perception that large-scale fishing operations are powerful forces altering the structure and function of marine ecosystems. It is acknowledged that management needs to better account for variations in ocean productivity, stock structure, and changing social values. Many countries are contemplating how to improve ocean fishery management. In the United States, fishery management bodies are experiencing pressure to undertake the daunting task of moving from their current single-species management plans to EBFM. Impediments include lack of a clear definition of EBFM, what it entails, or how to proceed. In this paper, characteristics of fishery management that are unique to EBFM are identified. The transition to EBFM needs to be evolutionary rather than revolutionary. A course of action is outlined that can be used to guide this transition. Modeling approaches and metrics useful for planning, implementing, and evaluating EBFM are discussed, with particular emphasis on management strategy evaluation. {\textcopyright} 2007 NRC.},

abstract = {Regime shifts are large, long-lasting changes in ecosystems. They are often hard to predict but may have leading indicators which are detectable in advance. Potential leading indicators include wider swings in dynamics of key ecosystem variables, slower return rates after perturbation and shift of variance towards lower frequencies. We evaluated these indicators using a food web model calibrated to long-term whole-lake experiments. We investigated whether impending regime shifts driven by gradual increase in exploitation of the top predator can create signals that cascade through food webs and be discerned in phytoplankton. Substantial changes in standard deviations, return rates and spectra occurred near the switch point, even two trophic levels removed from the regime shift in fishes. Signals of regime shift can be detected well in advance, if the driver of the regime shift changes much more slowly than the dynamics of key ecosystem variables which can be sampled frequently enough to measure the indicators. However, the regime shift may occur long after the driver has passed the critical point, because of very slow transient dynamics near the critical point. Thus, the ecosystem can be poised for regime shift by the time the signal is discernible. Field tests are needed to evaluate these indicators.},

abstract = {Small pelagic fish like sardine, anchovy and herring feed on zooplankton and are in turn prey for fish higher up in the food chain. They are therefore expected to play a vital role in transfer of energy between levels in the food chain. Some stocks of small pelagics are extremely large and subject to very substantial fluctuations caused by environmental factors. They are also very vulnerable to exploitation due to schooling behavior and highly efficient fishing technology. Several such stocks crashed in the 20th century as a result of heavy exploitation and/or adverse environmental changes. The effect of four such stock crashes on other fisheries are reviewed and found to be limited or nonexistent. This puts into perspective a recent report from the Lenfest Foundation, which examines small pelagics and their role in the ecosystem and finds that certain sea bird populations have been severely affected by exploitation of small pelagics. The report recommends more conservative management of small pelagics to limit the effects on predators, but makes no effort to weigh this against the contribution of forage fish to food production.},

abstract = {1. Positive species interactions are increasingly recognized as important drivers of community structure and ecosystem functioning. Although the literature on facilitative interactions in terrestrial environments has been reviewed and emerging patterns have been synthesized, comparable attempts are lacking for the marine realm. 2. By means of a quantitative survey of the literature, I provide a critical summary of current knowledge on positive species interactions in marine environments. In particular, I (i) assess how marine facilitation research compares to that carried out in terrestrial environments in terms of focus and philosophical approach; (ii) illustrate the mechanisms by which facilitation takes place in different habitats; (iii) assess whether benefactor and beneficiary species are more likely to belong to the same or to a different trophic level; and (iv) provide examples of how including facilitation into ecological theory might advance our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate ecosystem functioning. 3. Except for some studies in intertidal habitats, few studies in marine environments have been framed within mainstream facilitation theory (e.g. the Stress Gradient Hypothesis) and research does not seem to be organized in a self-contained theme. Amelioration of physical conditions appears to be the most common mechanism of facilitation in intertidal habitats, whilst associational defence predominates in the subtidal. 4. In contrast to the terrestrial literature, dominated by plant-plant interactions, marine benefactors and beneficiary species often belong to different trophic levels. This might imply little overlapping of resource niches or a differential response to environmental conditions or consumer pressure, with implications for the persistence of facilitative effects at the extreme ends of stress gradients. 5. Recent research shows that facilitation can enhance temporal variability and invasibility of marine communities and emphasizes the central role of positive species interactions in regulating the functioning of natural ecosystems. {\{}6.Synthesis.{\}} Studies encompassing a wide variety of life histories and environmental conditions are central to achieving a unified facilitation theory. Research in marine environments can provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying variations in the strength and direction of species interactions, but this will require greater awareness and consideration of facilitation.},

abstract = {Trophic cascades are textbook examples of predator indirect effects on ecological systems. Yet there is considerable debate about their nature, strength and overall importance. This debate stems in part from continued uncertainty about the ultimate mechanisms driving cascading effects. We present a synthesis of empirical evidence in support of one possible ultimate mechanism: the foraging-predation risk trade-offs undertaken by intermediary species. We show that simple trade-off behaviour can lead to both positive and negative indirect effects of predators on plant resources and hence can explain considerable contingency on the nature and strength of cascading effects among systems. Thus, predicting the sign and strength of indirect effect simply requires knowledge of habitat and resource use by prey with regard to predators? presence, habitat use and hunting mode. The synthesis allows us to postulate a hypothesis for new conceptualization of trophic cascades which is to be viewed as an ultimate trade-off between intervening species. In this context, different predators apply different rules of engagement based on their hunting mode and habitat use. These different rules then determine whether behavioural effects persist or attenuate at the level of the food chain.},

A film thickness comparable to the ballistic electron depth in gold (≈100 nm) is considered, evidencing a significant change of the temperature spatial profile inside the target material, which eventually influences the material decomposition. Particular emphasis is given to the process of nanoparticle generation. The simulations indicate a more uniform heating of the sample in the case of the thin film, which is accompanied by a more homogeneous size distribution of the nanoparticles produced in the ablation process. An experimental characterization of the ultrashort-pulse ablation process is also carried out. The produced nanoparticles are collected on suitable substrates, and atomic force microscopy analysis of less than one layer deposits is performed. An≈2× narrowing of the nanoparticles equivalent to spherical diameter size distribution is observed in the case of ablation of the gold thin film, in fairly good agreementwith the theo- retical predictions.Moreover, interesting changes of the nanoparticle shape are evidenced,which are correlated to the changes in the nanoparticle ablation plume dynamics, as studied by time-gated imaging of its self- emission. Our findings suggest ultrashort-pulse laser ablation of thin films as a viable route to achieve a more uniformnanoparticle size distribution.},

We found striking differences in the functional response of cod on alternative prey, and these were consistent with the observed patterns in interaction strengths. Cod predation was the dominant source of mortality for age-1 and age-2 sprat but was only important for age-1 herring. Moreover, the magnitude of predation mortality on age-1 and age-2 sprat was highly sensitive to cod biomass, whereas predation mortality on herring was only moderately sensitive to cod biomass. These analyses suggest the possibility that food webs are comprised of linkages that vary with respect to the magnitude and importance of predation mortality and how this mortality varies with changes in predator abundance.},

abstract = {The spawning strategy of cod has evolved through natural selection to give larvae a good start in life. Therefore, larval drift, growth, and survival are key processes to understand spawning strategies. Spawning of Northeast Arctic (NA) cod stretches from late February to early May over 1500 km along the Norwegian coast. Hatching occurs from late March to late May, a period when the number of daylight hours increases from 11 to 17. Larval feeding opportunities are constrained by prey abundance and environmental variables such as light, while temperature determines the maximum growth potential. Here, we model seasonal and latitudinal constraints on larval cod growth by combining predictions from a bio-physically coupled model providing input on nauplii production and development (Calanus finmarchicus), a 3D physical model (ROMS) providing flow- and temperature-fields, and an individual-based model (IBM) of larval cod physiology and feeding processes. Our aim is to investigate the relative significance of temperature, turbulence, light, and prey density on growth of larval cod by integrative modeling. The models suggest that larval cod experience lower growth if hatched early in the season (prior to mid-April) when the foraging hours are few. Larval cod hatched in early May experience higher temperatures, better growth conditions, and are less susceptible to prey limitation due to increased day-length. We also suggest that increased prey abundance is more valuable early in the spawning season compared to later, when larvae have better feeding conditions. The model quantifies the strong relationship between larval feeding and growth in relation to day-length, time of the season, and water temperature, and the seasonal and spatial appearance of prey. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We present a maximum likelihood procedure for estimating population growth and mortality parameters by simultaneously analysing size frequency and growth increment data. The model uses von Bertalanffy growth with variability among individuals in the two parameters that determine growth rate, and size-dependent mortality. Analyzing growth increments together with size frequencies reduces the statistical confounding of the natural mortality rate with von Bertalanffy's K parameter. We assume steady-state (constant recruitment) conditions for the size distributions; hence the method does not depend on age modes in the distribution. We evaluate the bias and precision of estimates obtained for growth-dominated distributions typical of the red sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) in northern California, although the method and its evaluation could be applied as easily to mortality-dominated or bimodal distributions. The method provides good estimates with sample sizes as low as 200 individuals in a size distribution and 30 growth increments. Results are robust to random variability in recruitment, measurement error, and sampling selectivity up to the size where about one third of the distribution is affected. Estimation of the fishing mortality rate could require size distributions from both an unharvested and a harvested population. Estimates of growth and mortality rates depend critically on reliable growth data.},

abstract = {The primary goals of marine reserves include protecting biodiversity and ecosystem structure. Therefore, a multispecies approach to designing and monitoring reserve networks is necessary. To gain insight into how the interactions between species in marine communities may affect reserve design, we synthesize marine reserve community models and community models with habitat destruction and fragmentation, and we develop new extensions of existing models. This synthesis highlights the potential for species interactions to alter reserve design criteria; in particular, accounting for species interactions often leads to an increase in reserve size necessary to protect populations. Accounting for species interactions also indicates the need to base reserve design and monitoring on a variety of species, especially long-distance dispersers, inferior colonizers, and specialists. Finally, the new model extensions highlight how, given dispersal, source populations outside reserves as well as increases in fished populations after reserve establishment may negatively affect reserve populations of competitors or prey. Therefore, multispecies harvest dynamics outside reserves and before reserve establishment are critical to determining the appropriate reserve size, spacing, and expectations after establishment. These models highlight the importance of species interactions to reserve design and provide guidelines for how this complexity can begin to be incorporated into conservation planning. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Fisheries scientists provide stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments to support interdisplinary fisheries management in the US and worldwide. These assessment activities have evolved different models, using different review standards, and are communicated using different vocabulary. Recent research shows that spatio-temporal models can estimate population density for multiple locations, times, and species, and that this is a “common currency” for addressing core goals in stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments. I therefore review the history and “design principles” for one spatio-temporal modelling package, the Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal (VAST) package. I then provide guidance on fifteen major decisions that must be made by users of VAST, including: whether to use a univariate or multivariate model; when to include spatial and/or spatio-temporal variation; how many factors to use within a multivariate model; whether to include density or catchability covariates; and when to include a temporal correlation on model components. I finally demonstrate these decisions using three case studies. The first develops indices of abundance, distribution shift, and range expansion for arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) in the Eastern Bering Sea, showing the range expansion for this species. The second involves “species ordination” of eight groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey, which highlights the different spatial distribution of flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) relative to sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) and dover sole (Microstomus pacificus). The third involves a short-term forecast of the proportion of coastwide abundance for five groundfishes within three spatial strata in the US West Coast groundfish bottom trawl survey, and predicts large interannual variability (and high uncertainty) in the distribution of lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus). I conclude by recommending further research exploring the benefits and limitations of a “common currency” approach to stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments, and discuss extending this approach to optimal survey design and economic assessments.},

abstract = {End-to-end marine ecosystem models link climate and oceanography to the food web and human activities. These models can be used as forecasting tools, to strategically evaluate management options and to support ecosystem-based management. Here we report the results of such forecasts in the California Current, using an Atlantis end-to-end model. We worked collaboratively with fishery managers at NOAA's regional offices and staff at the National Marine Sanctuaries (NMS) to explore the impact of fishery policies on management objectives at different spatial scales, from single Marine Sanctuaries to the entire Northern California Current. In addition to examining Status Quo management, we explored the consequences of several gear switching and spatial management scenarios. Of the scenarios that involved large scale management changes, no single scenario maximized all performance metrics. Any policy choice would involve trade-offs between stakeholder groups and policy goals. For example, a coast-wide 25{\%} gear shift from trawl to pot or longline appeared to be one possible compromise between an increase in spatial management (which sacrificed revenue) and scenarios such as the one consolidating bottom impacts to deeper areas (which did not perform substantially differently from Status Quo). Judged on a coast-wide scale, most of the scenarios that involved minor or local management changes (e.g. within Monterey Bay NMS only) yielded results similar to Status Quo. When impacts did occur in these cases, they often involved local interactions that were difficult to predict a priori based solely on fishing patterns. However, judged on the local scale, deviation from Status Quo did emerge, particularly for metrics related to stationary species or variables (i.e. habitat and local metrics of landed value or bycatch). We also found that isolated management actions within Monterey Bay NMS would cause local fishers to pay a cost for conservation, in terms of reductions in landed value. However, this cost was minimal when local conservation actions were part of a concerted coast-wide plan. The simulations demonstrate the utility of using the Atlantis end-to-end ecosystem model within NOAA's Integrated Ecosystem Assessment, by illustrating an end-to-end modeling tool that allows consideration of multiple management alternatives that are relevant to numerous state, federal and private interests. ?? 2012.},

Here we demonstrate that biological reference points generated by explicitly incorporating predation mortality into population dynamic models are generally more conservative (e.g., recommend higher standing biomass) than those produced using traditional assessment methods. Because biological reference points are the benchmark against which fisheries management decisions are made, they should reflect the ecological realities faced by each species to the fullest extent possible. We suggest much broader consideration of the more conservative biological reference points produced by explicitly incorporating predation mortality as a component of natural mortality to population models. This approach could implement a powerful yet tractable facet of ecosystem based fisheries management and is especially important for those stocks where predation mortality is known or suspected to be important. ?? 2010.},

abstract = {Estimating trends in abundance from fishery catch rates is one of the oldest endeavors in fisheries science. However, many jurisdictions do not analyze fishery catch rates due to concerns that these data confound changes in fishing behavior (adjustments in fishing location or gear operation) with trends in abundance. In response, we developed a spatial dynamic factor analysis (SDFA) model that decomposes covariation in multispecies catch rates into components representing spatial variation and fishing behavior. SDFA estimates spatiotemporal variation in fish density for multiple species and accounts for fisher behavior at large spatial scales (i.e., choice of fishing location) while controlling for fisher behavior at fine spatial scales (e.g., daily timing of fishing activity). We first use a multispecies simulation experiment to show that SDFA decreases bias in abundance indices relative to ignoring spatial adjustments and fishing tactics.Wethen present results for a case study involving petrale sole (Eopsetta jordani) in the California Current, for which SDFA estimates initially stable and then increasing abundance for the period 1986–2003, in accordance with fishery-independent survey and stock assessment estimates.},

abstract = {Studies on trophic cascades involving large carnivores typically are limited by a lack of replication and control, giving rise to a spirited debate over the ecological role of these iconic species. We argue that much of this debate can be resolved by decomposing the trophic cascade hypothesis into three constituent interactions, quantifying each interaction individually, and accommodating alternative hypotheses. We advocate for a novel approach that couples the rigor characterizing foundational work on trophic cascades (i.e., from studies carried out in mesocosm and whole lake systems) with the conservation relevance of large carnivore-dominated food webs. Because of their iconic status, it is crucial that inferences about the ecological role of large carnivores rise to meet the same rigorous standards to which other studies in community ecology are held. Large carnivores are believed to play a key role in determining ecosystem properties via trophic cascades. While the recovery of large carnivore populations is generally heralded as a conservation success story, the common assertion that such recoveries alter plant communities and other ecosystem properties is currently not supported by the standards of evidence expected in other scientific disciplines.There have been very few replicated and controlled experiments documenting evidence for trophic cascades involving large carnivores, leaving a knowledge gap with crucial implications for ecology and wildlife conservation.The absence of a mechanistic understanding of food web dynamics and weak inference in many studies combine to obfuscate the mechanisms underlying if and how large carnivores affect ecosystems.},

abstract = {Takens' theorem (1981) shows how lagged variables of a single time series can be used as proxy variables to reconstruct an attractor for an underlying dynamic process. State space reconstruction (SSR) from single time series has been a powerful approach for the analysis of the complex, non-linear systems that appear ubiquitous in the natural and human world. The main shortcoming of these methods is the phenomenological nature of attractor reconstructions. Moreover, applied studies show that these single time series reconstructions can often be improved ad hoc by including multiple dynamically coupled time series in the reconstructions, to provide a more mechanistic model. Here we provide three analytical proofs that add to the growing literature to generalize Takens' work and that demonstrate how multiple time series can be used in attractor reconstructions. These expanded results (Takens' theorem is a special case) apply to a wide variety of natural systems having parallel time series observations for variables believed to be related to the same dynamic manifold. The potential information leverage provided by multiple embeddings created from different combinations of variables (and their lags) can pave the way for new applied techniques to exploit the time-limited, but parallel observations of natural systems, such as coupled ecological systems, geophysical systems, and financial systems. This paper aims to justify and help open this potential growth area for SSR applications in the natural sciences.},

abstract = {The giant kelp Macrocystis is the world's largest benthic organism and most widely distributed kelp taxon, serving as the foundation for diverse and energy-rich habitats that are of great ecological and economical importance. Although the basic and applied literature on Macro- cystis is extensive and multinational, studies of large Macrocystis forests in the northeastern Pacific have received the greatest attention. This review synthesises the existing Macrocystis literature into a more global perspective. During the last 20 yr, the primary literature has shifted from descriptive and experimental studies of local Macrocystis distribution, abundance and population and commu- nity structure (e.g., competition and herbivory) to comprehensive investigations of Macrocystis life history, dispersal, recruitment, physiology and broad-scale variability in population and community processes. Ample evidence now suggests that the genus is monospecific. Due to its highly variable physiology and life history, Macrocystis occupies a wide variety of environments (intertidal to 60+ m, boreal to warm temperate) and sporophytes take on a variety of morphological forms. Macrocystis sporophytes are highly responsive to environmental variability, resulting in differential population dynamics and effects of Macrocystis on its local environment. Within the large subtidal giant kelp forests of southern California, Macrocystis sporophytes live long, form extensive surface canopies that shade the substratum and dampen currents, and produce and retain copious amounts of reproductive propagules. The majority of subtidal Macrocystis populations worldwide, however, are small, narrow, fringing forests that are productive and modify environmental resources (e.g., light), yet are more dynamic than their large southern California counterparts with local recruitment probably resulting from remote propagule production. When intertidal, Macrocystis populations exhibit vegetative propagation. Growth of high-latitude Macrocystis sporophytes is seasonal, coin- cident with temporal variability in insolation, whereas growth at low latitudes tracks more episodic variability in nutrient delivery. Although Macrocystis habitat and energy provision varies with such ecotypic variability in morphology and productivity, the few available studies indicate that Macrocystis -associated communities are universally diverse and productive. Furthermore, temporal and spatial variability in the structure and dynamics of these systems appears to be driven by processes that regulate Macrocystis distribution, abundance and productivity, rather than the con- sumptive processes that make some other kelp systems vulnerable to overexploitation. This global synthesis suggests that the great plasticity in Macrocystis form and function is a key determinant of the great global ecological success of Macrocystis},

abstract = {On marine rocky shores, macroalgal herbivory is often intense, such that the cascading effects of fish predation may contribute to the control of algal communities. To estimate the magnitudes of top-down and bottom-up control on a macroalgal community, we manipulated the access of carnivorous fish to macroalgal colonization substrates, as well as nutrient availability, at two sub-littoral depths. There were three levels of fish manipulation: natural fish community, no fish and the enclosure of one common species, the perch, Perca fluviatilis. We found a clear cascade effect of fish predation on both the total density and several individual species of macroalgae, which was more pronounced in deep than shallow water. The density of the dominant grazers, i.e. snails, increased in nutrient-enriched conditions; perch were inefficient in controlling herbivores, and had therefore no cascading effect on algal densities under such conditions. Although nutrients enhanced the growth of opportunistic algae, herbivores, in the absence of fish, inhibited this response. While algal diversity was higher in shallow than in deep water, the enrichment effect was opposite at the two depths with lowered diversity in the shallows and increased at depth. Our results indicate that fish predation is an efficient regulator of meso-herbivores and that its effect thereby cascades onto the producer trophic level such that both perennial and opportunistic algae benefit from the presence of fish. This cascade effect is probably stronger at depth where predation efficiency is less disturbed by wave motion. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Mace2001,
abstract = {In 1977, Peter Larkin published his now-famous paper, 'An epitaph for the concept of maximum sustainable yield'. Larkin criticized the concept of single-species maximum sustained yield (MSY) for many reasons, including the possibility that it may not guard against recruitment failure, and the impossibility of maximising sustainable yields for all species simultaneously. However, in recent years, there has been a fundamental change in the perception of the fishing mortality associated with MSY (FMSY) as a limit to be avoided rather than a target that can routinely be exceeded. The concept of FMSY as a limit is embodied in several United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) agreements and guidelines, and has now been incorporated into the US Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. As a result, the United States now requires the development of overfishing definitions based on biological reference points that treat FMSY as a limit reference point and must also define a lower limit on biomass below which rebuilding plans with strict time horizons must be developed. This represents a major paradigm shift from the previously mandated (but often unachieved) objective to simply maintain fishing mortalities at levles below those associated with recruitment overfishing. In many cases, it requires substantial reductions in current fishing mortality levels. Therefore, the necessity of the new paradigm is continually questioned. This paper draws on examples from several fisheries, but specifically focuses on the recent US experience illustrating the practical difficulties of reducing fishing mortality to levels below those corresponding to MSY. However, several studies suggest that even more substantial reductions in fishing mortality may be necessary if ecosystem considerations, such as multispecies interactions, maintenance of biodiversity and genetic diversity, and reduction of bycatch and waste, are taken into account. The pros and cons of moving beyond single-species assessment and mangement are discussed. A US plan for improving stock assessments indicates that even a 'basic' objective such as 'adequate baseline monitoring of all managed species' may be extremely costly. Thus, the suggestion of Larkin (1983, 1997) that the costs of the catch may preclude comprehensive ecosystem management. More importantly, neither single-species nor ecosystem-based fisheries management is likely to improve appreciably unless levels of fishing capacity are aligned with resource productivity, as is currently being promoted by FAO and several individual nations.},

abstract = {Fishing can trigger trophic cascades that alter community structure and dynamics and thus modify ecosystem attributes. We combined ecological data of sea urchin and macroalgal abundance with fishery data of spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus) landings to evaluate whether: (1) patterns in the abundance and biomass among lobster (predator), sea urchins (grazer), and macroalgae (primary producer) in giant kelp forest communities indicated the presence of top-down control on urchins and macroalgae, and (2) lobster fishing triggers a trophic cascade leading to increased sea urchin densities and decreased macroalgal biomass. Eight years of data from eight rocky subtidal reefs known to support giant kelp forests near Santa Barbara, CA, USA, were analyzed in three-tiered least-squares regression models to evaluate the relationships between: (1) lobster abundance and sea urchin density, and (2) sea urchin density and macroalgal biomass. The models included reef physical structure and water depth. Results revealed a trend towards decreasing urchin density with increasing lobster abundance but little evidence that urchins control the biomass of macroalgae. Urchin density was highly correlated with habitat structure, although not water depth. To evaluate whether fishing triggered a trophic cascade we pooled data across all treatments to examine the extent to which sea urchin density and macroalgal biomass were related to the intensity of lobster fishing (as indicated by the density of traps pulled). We found that, with one exception, sea urchins remained more abundant at heavily fished sites, supporting the idea that fishing for lobsters releases top-down control on urchin grazers. Macroalgal biomass, however, was positively correlated with lobster fishing intensity, which contradicts the trophic cascade model. Collectively, our results suggest that factors other than urchin grazing play a major role in controlling macroalgal biomass in southern California kelp forests, and that lobster fishing does not always catalyze a top-down trophic cascade.},

abstract = {The red sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus franciscanus, is one of the larger if not the largest shallow water sea urchin species in the world, with a maximum test diameter gt 16 cm. It is a numerically and functionally important element of benthic assemblages along the west coast of North America and is the basis of a commercial fishery. Despite these points, there are very few data on its basic population biology. We studied 2 intertidal populations of S. franciscanus from exposed sandstone benches on San Nicolas Island, California, USA, and estimated growth and survival. The shapes of its growth curves were similar to many tropical and temperate species in that ca 42{\%} of asymptotic size was attained during the first year of growth. Sea urchins at Cosign Cove grew more slowly and attained a smaller maximum size than did those at Northwest Point, so at 10 yr diameters would be 6.7 and 7.9 cm, respectively. Annual mortality rate was about 10{\%} for both sites. Although growth rates were different at the 2 sites at San Nicolas Island, relatives sizes of the demi-pyramids ('jaws') of Aristotle's lantern were the same. Size of demi-pyramids relative to test diameter has been shown to be responsive to food abundance in other sea urchin species, so the different growth rates at the 2 sites either represent responses to environmental factors other than food or relative growth of jaws in S. franciscanus is more canalized than in other sea urchin species.},

abstract = {The red sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus franciscanus, is a conspicuous mem- ber of subtidal communities in the north Pacific. Within the last decade, this ecologically important species has been exposed to intense harvesting for the first time ever. Analysis of population census data suggest that harvestable size urchins have rapidly declined in shallow regions while catch-per-effort and landings data suggest that divers have maintained high landings by exploiting more distant and difficult fishing areas, including deeper areas. We present a size-structured model for the red sea urchin both to estimate what previous levels of harvesting mortality were and to explore what effect future harvesting strategies might have on population trajectories. Using population census data, we explore three models: one that would result in an equilibrial population size in the absence of fishing, one that includes positive density dependence (an "Allee effect"), and one that incorporates realistic variability in recruitment. Our principal findings are that annual fishing mortality levels that best fit the observed census data in the past (1984-1993) were 0.38-0.49 and represent a 70-90{\%} decrease in the survivorship of harvestable urchins in the years of fishing. Under a variety of fishing strategies, 100-yr projections indicated that the inclusion of an Allee effect or variability in recruitment could drive the harvestable population to {\textless} 50{\%} of present estimated population size at relatively low annual fishing mortality values. Our simulations also indicated that, although a yearly fishery would have higher yields, a rotational fishery would maintain populations at a level less likely to cause irreversible decline. The wealth of empirical evidence that sea urchins are an important component of nearshore communities should encourage management strategies that emphasize long-term population viability.},

abstract = {Study of interactions among fishes and benthic invertebrates off southern California's Santa Catalina Island showed the great extent to which taxa are defined by trophic relations. The dominant fishes there are acanthopterygian teleosts, with the serranine serranid Paralabrax clathratus morphologically nearest the evolutionary mainstream. Because mainstream species have morphologies similar to their progenitors, marine communities have a long history of adaptations to threats from generalized predators like P. clathratus. Species examined at Santa Catalina indicate this experience has produced four basic defenses: smallness, which presents difficulties for predators with large and simply constructed feeding mechanisms; dissemblance, as through camouflage, which makes detection by visual hunters difficult; inedibility, which is attained by incorporating materials that an unspecialized digestive system cannot accommodate; and nocturnality, which results in avoiding diurnal predators altogether. Examination of trophic relations among the major fishes in Santa Catalina communities shows each with specialized ways to counter these defenses. Prey smallness has been met by reducing size of mouth relative to size of prey, either by evolving as smaller fishes or through structural changes in head and jaws. Prey dissemblance has been accommodated through enhanced visual acuity and varied means to remain an unrecognized threat while waiting for prey to move. Inedibility has been countered by developing specialized features of the alimentary tract, including dentition, while adjustments to nocturnality have included enhanced sensory capabilities that detect prey in low light. These adaptations to prey defenses define varied lines of divergence from the teleost mainstream as represented atbreak Santa Catalina.},

abstract = {An ecosystem approach to forage fish management is required because forage fish support large fisheries, are prey for many valued species in marine food webs, and provide important social and cultural benefits to humans. Complex ecosystem models are often used to evaluate potential ecosystem consequences of forage fish fisheries, but there is seldom sufficient data to parameterize them, and full consideration of uncertainty is impossible. Models of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem assessment (MICE) provide a link between full ecosystem models and tactical (usually single-species) models typically used in fisheries management. MICE are ideal tools to form the basis for management strategy evaluations that compare the ability of candidate strategies to achieve goals related to target fisheries and broader ecosystem protection objectives. A MICE model is developed for the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) that focuses on the fishery for the northern subpopulation of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sajax) and the indirect impacts of the fishery on place-based predators, in particular brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis) and California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), in the Southern California Bight. The model includes three forage species (sardine, northern anchovy Engraulis mordax, and ???other forage???), an ???other prey??? category, and two predator species (brown pelican and California sea lion) and evaluates the impacts of variable forage availability on adult predator reproductive success and survival. Parameterization of the model is based on available monitoring data and assessment outputs. The model is used to assess the ecosystem and fishery consequences of the current sardine management systems for Mexico, the USA, and Canada, with a focus on identifying which among a long list of sources of uncertainty in the system are most consequential for predictions of fishery impacts on predators. Key sources of uncertainty to consider in ecosystem assessments for the CCE are how prey abundance and availability impact predator demography and the extent to which the dynamics of prey populations are driven by environmental factors. Data are available for some of these sources of uncertainty for CCE sardine management, but much uncertainty remains, necessitating exploration of sensitivity to alternative model formulations and parameter values when providing advice on management strategies to decision makers.},

In this article, I use a 19-year-long kelp forest-monitoring data set from the Channel Islands National Park (a) to identify associations between subtidal species and forested or deforested habitats, (b) to generate an idealized food web for Southern California giant kelp forests in order to identify the primary conduits of energy flow through the sys- tem, and (c) to determine changes in the diversity and complexity of this food web due to localized giant kelp deforestation. A total of 275 common species were observed in the park between 1982 and 2000, of which 36{\%} occurred significantly more often in kelp-forested areas than in deforested areas (that is, sea urchin barrens); 25 species were found exclusively in forested areas.

The producer level of the food web was diverse, although giant kelp apparently represents the great- est single source of fixed carbon through either direct grazing or the production of phytodetritus. Primary, secondary and tertiary consumer levels were also represented by numerous species, and generalist consumers were common. With defores- tation, the source of primary production shifts from primarily kelps to ephemeral microalgae, macroal- gae, and phytoplankton. These results support the reliance of giant kelp forest food-web structure and diversity on the presence of the forest itself.},

abstract = {Decadal fluctuations in salinity, nutrients, chlorophyll, a variety of zooplankton taxa, and fish stocks in the Northeast Pacific are often poorly correlated with the most widely-used index of large-scale climate variability in the region - the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). We define a new pattern of climate change, the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) and show that its variability is significantly correlated with previously unexplained fluctuations of salinity, nutrients and chlorophyll. Fluctuations in the NPGO are driven by regional and basin-scale variations in wind-driven upwelling and horizontal advection – the fundamental processes controlling salinity and nutrient concentrations. Nutrient fluctuations drive concomitant changes in phytoplankton concentrations, and may force similar variability in higher trophic levels. The NPGO thus provides a strong indicator of fluctuations in the mechanisms driving planktonic ecosystem dynamics. The NPGO pattern extends beyond the North Pacific and is part of a global-scale mode of climate variability that is evident in global sea level trends and sea surface temperature. Therefore the amplification of the NPGO variance found in observations and in global warming simulations implies that the NPGO may play an increasingly important role in forcing global-scale decadal changes in marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {During the last three decades, population abundances of eastern Bering Sea (EBS) crab stocks fluctuated greatly, driven by highly variable recruitment. In recent years, abundances of these stocks have been very low compared to historical levels. This study aims to understand recruitment variation of six stocks of red king (Paralithodes camtschaticus), blue king (P. platypus), Tanner (Chionoecetes bairdi), and snow (C. opilio) crabs in the EBS. Most crab recruitment time series are not significantly correlated with each other. Spatial distributions of three broadly distributed crab stocks (EBS snow and Tanner crabs and Bristol Bay red king crab) have changed considerably over time, possibly related in part to the regime shift in climate and physical oceanography in 1976-1977. Three climate-forcing hypotheses on larval survival have been proposed to explain crab recruitment variation of Bristol Bay red king crab and EBS Tanner and snow crabs. Some empirical evidence supports speculation that groundfish predation may play an important role in crab recruitment success in the EBS. However, spatial dynamics in the geographic distributions of groundfish and crabs over time make it difficult to relate crab recruitment strength to groundfish biomass. Comprehensive field and spatially explicit modeling studies are needed to test the hypotheses and better understand the relative importance and compound effects of bottom-up and top-down controls on crab recruitment. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We highlight three types of conflicts created by a single-species focus: (1) recovering predator populations that increase competition with humans for the same prey, (2) new tradeoffs that emerge when protected predators consume protected prey, and (3) multiple predator populations that compete for the same limited prey. We use two food webs with parallel conservation challenges, the Northeast Pacific Ocean and the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem, to demonstrate legal/policy conflicts and the policy levers that exist to ameliorate conflicts. In some cases, scientific uncertainty about the ecological interaction hinders progress towards resolving conflicts. In others, available policy options are insufficient. In all cases, management decisions must be made in the face of an unknown future. We suggest a framework that incorporates multispecies science, policy tools, and tradeoff analyses into management.},

abstract = {Quantitative models have been used extensively to solve complex problems in sea otter conservation. Models represent powerful tools for simplifying and integrating data across a wide range of topics, from behavior and physiology to complex population dynamics, genetics, disease ecology, food-web interactions, and physical/biological oceanography. When based on solid data and sound assumptions, models allow scientists to test hypotheses, elucidate the underlying mechanisms of a particular problem, and make sound conservation decisions. Here I discuss several branches of conservation science in which sea otter researchers have used mathematical models to aid in their research, including behavior, population dynamics, community interactions, and applied conservation questions. For each subject area, I explain some of the key research questions, provide examples of how models have been used to help answer those questions, and highlight promising areas for future and ongoing work in sea otter conservation. Finally I explore some of the general lessons that can be drawn from these examples, focusing on points that may be useful for wildlife conservation more broadly.},

abstract = {Shallow lakes are known to exhibit alternative states in their biotic structure. Lakes dominated by submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) are ‘‘clear,'' while lakes dominated by algae (high concentrations of chlorophyll a [Chl a]) are ‘‘turbid.'' The roles of total phosphorus (TP) and SAV in defining these alternative states were examined for up to 6 yr in 24 naturally eutrophic shallow lakes (12.4–670.4 mg TP L21) with variable SAV cover (0–100{\%}) on the western Boreal Plain in Alberta, Canada. Clear lakes had ,18 mg Chl a L21. Sixty-seven percent of lakes were clear in any given year, but individual lakes did not remain clear over consecutive years. While 29{\%} did not switch, 71{\%} of lakes were unstable, with 57{\%} switching states once and 14{\%} switching more than once. To increase the temporal and spatial scale of analysis, we used Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite imagery (1984– 2003) to classify clarity for up to 20 yr in 82 naturally eutrophic shallow lakes. Approximately 80{\%} of lakes were unstable, with 7{\%} switching once and more than 73{\%} switching 2–9 times. Only 20{\%} of lakes were stable and clear. Switches in lake clarity were related to TP but were also dependent on the abundance of SAV. For lakes with high SAV, the TP threshold for the transition from clear to turbid was 275 mg TP L21, while for lakes with low SAV, the TP threshold was 50 mg TP L21. Given the harsh winter conditions, including lakes with ice depths of up to 0.7 m and anoxia leading to winterkill of aquatic communities, these systems are strongly abiotically regulated and lack mechanisms that maintain a lake in a stable state.},

abstract = {In this paper we present results from dynamic simulations of the Northern California Current ecosystem, based on historical estimates of fishing mortality, relative fishing effort, and climate forcing. Climate can affect ecosystem productivity and dynamics both from the bottom-up (through short- and long-term variability in primary and secondary production) as well as from the top-down (through variability in the abundance and spatial distribution of key predators). We have explored how the simplistic application of climate forcing through both bottom-up and top-down mechanisms improves the fit of the model dynamics to observed population trends and reported catches for exploited components of the ecosystem. We find that using climate as either a bottom-up or a top-down forcing mechanism results in substantial improvements in model performance, such that much of the variability observed in single species models and dynamics can be replicated in a multi-species approach. Using multiple climate variables (both bottom-up and top-down) simultaneously did not provide significant improvement over a model with only one forcing. In general, results suggest that there do not appear to be strong trophic interactions among many of the longer-lived, slower-growing rockfish, roundfish and flatfish in this ecosystem, although strong interactions were observed in shrimp, salmon and small flatfish populations where high turnover and predation rates have been coupled with substantial changes in many predator populations over the last 40 years.},

abstract = {Determining the relative importance of local and regional processes for the distribution of population abundance is a fundamental but contentious issue in ecology. In marine systems, classical theory holds that the influence of demographic processes and dispersal is confined to local populations whereas the environment controls regional patterns of abundance. Here, we use spatial synchrony to compare the distribution of population abundance of the dominant mussel Mytilus californianus observed along the West Coast of the United States to that predicted by dynamical models undergoing different dispersal and environmental treatments to infer the relative influence of local and regional processes. We reveal synchronized fluctuations in the abundance of mussel populations across a whole continent despite limited larval dispersal and strong environmental forcing. We show that dispersal among neighboring populations interacts with local demographic processes to generate characteristic patterns of spatial synchrony that can govern the dynamic distribution of mussel abundance over 1,800 km of coastline. Our study emphasizes the importance of dispersal and local dynamics for the distribution of abundance at the continental scale. It further highlights potential limits to the use of "climate envelope" models for predicting the response of large-scale ecosystems to global climate change.},

abstract = {The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) has been described by some as a long-lived El Ni{\{}{\~{n}}{\}}o-like pattern of Pacific climate variability, and by others as a blend of two sometimes independent modes having distinct spatial and temporal characteristics of North Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) variability. A growing body of evidence highlights a strong tendency for PDO impacts in the Southern Hemisphere, with important surface climate anomalies over the mid-latitude South Pacific Ocean, Australia and South America. Several independent studies find evidence for just two full PDO cycles in the past century: ``cool'' PDO regimes prevailed from 1890--1924 and again from 1947--1976, while ``warm'' PDO regimes dominated from 1925--1946 and from 1977 through (at least) the mid-1990's. Interdecadal changes in Pacific climate have widespread impacts on natural systems, including water resources in the Americas and many marine fisheries in the North Pacific. Tree-ring and Pacific coral based climate reconstructions suggest that PDO variations---at a range of varying time scales---can be traced back to at least 1600, although there are important differences between different proxy reconstructions. While 20th Century PDO fluctuations were most energetic in two general periodicities---one from 15-to-25 years, and the other from 50-to-70 years---the mechanisms causing PDO variability remain unclear. To date, there is little in the way of observational evidence to support a mid-latitude coupled air-sea interaction for PDO, though there are several well-understood mechanisms that promote multi-year persistence in North Pacific upper ocean temperature anomalies.},

The growth indices (size increments at moulting in mm and in {\%} of premoult carapace width) were significantly higher in crabs reared at 5°C than in those reared at other temperatures. The relationship between the mean temperature (T) and intermoult period (D) of each instar was described by the heat summation theory equation: D=K∕(T−$\alpha$). The thermal constant K is the summation of the effective temperature for development (above the threshold temperature, $\alpha$) up to a selected biological end point. The thermal constant tended to increase and the threshold temperature tended to decrease with increasing mean premoult carapace width of each instar, reaching asymptotes of 1573 day-degrees and −4.7°C, respectively. Size- and temperature-dependent growth models were developed for snow crab juveniles.},

abstract = {Red and purple sea urchins (Mesocentrotus francisanus and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) cohabit the west coast of North America and exhibit behavioral switching between sheltering, when food is abundant, and emergence and overgrazing, when food is scarce. To better understand individual urchin foraging behavior, we conducted a series of time-lapse behavioral studies within and at the edge of a resilient sea urchin barren. Photographs were taken at 15-min intervals for weeklong periods to observe behavior (1) in different microtopographic settings, (2) in response to food additions, and (3) along a spatial gradient from the leading edge of a sea urchin grazing front to ;100 m behind it. Movement was limited for both species when crowded or in complex microtopography. Consistent differences in sheltering behaviors and diel movement patterns were observed between species in the presence and absence of food indicating behavioral niche differentiation. Red sea urchins responded to food falls at distances of at least 3mand exhibit an ability to return to shelters at similar distances. Both species exhibit (1) local movement for up to weeklong periods indicating constraints on bulk movement and grazing front formation, (2) decreased movement rates owing to crowding and microtopography analogous to traffic jams, and (3) consistent instraspecific differences in individual movement behaviors (i.e., personality). We propose how small-scale behavioral modes may scale to larger-scale local population movements and affect the dynamics of sea urchin overgrazing.},

abstract = {Complex nonlinear dynamics in marine fisheries create challenges for prediction and management, yet the extent to which they occur in fisheries is not well known. Using nonlinear forecasting models, we analysed over 200 time series of survey abundance and landings from two distinct ecosystems for patterns of dynamic complexity (dimensionality and nonlinear dynamics) and predictability. Differences in system dimensionality and nonlinear dynamics were associated with time series that reflected human intervention via fishing effort, implying the cou- pling between human and natural systems generated dynamics distinct from those detected in the natural resource subsystem alone. Estimated dimensionality was highest for landings and higher in abundance indices of unfished species than fished species. Fished species were more likely to display nonlinear dynamics than unfished species, and landings were significantly less predictable than abundance indices. Results were robust to variation in life history characteristics. Dynamics were predictable over a 1-year time horizon in seventy percent of time series, but predictability declined exponentially over a 5-year horizon. The ability to make predictions in fisheries systems is therefore extremely limited. To our knowledge, this is the first cross-system comparative study, and the first at the scale of individ- ual species, to analyse empirically the dynamic complexity observed in fisheries data and to quantify predictability broadly. We outline one application of short- term forecasts to a precautionary approach to fisheries management that could improve how uncertainty and forecast error are incorporated into assessment through catch limit buffers},

abstract = {There is a growing need to identify Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) for marine species. For seabirds, MPAs include those near breeding colonies, offshore foraging areas, inshore habitats for wintering species, and migratory bottlenecks. However, frequently there is a lack of readily available current and comprehensive data on foraging areas used by species from particular colonies. Therefore, representative breeding season foraging ranges for each species may be useful alongside other datasets for scoping candidate MPAs. We reviewed studies that estimated foraging range for 25 species of UK breeding seabirds. For representative foraging ranges, we prioritised studies, giving highest value to those based on direct tracking of birds (21{\%}); then those involving indirect estimates using flight speeds and time activity (12{\%}) followed by, boat, aerial, and land-based 'survey' observations (46{\%}); and finally we gave lowest value to speculative estimates (21{\%}). Highest confidence was placed in the foraging ranges of northern gannet (Morus bassanus), black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), and common guillemot (Uria aalge), and lowest for common gull (Larus canus), common eider (Somateria mollissima), Leach's (Oceanodroma leucorhoa) and European storm petrels (Hydrobates pelagicus). Both annual and colony-specific variation was evident for some species. Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus), northern gannet, and northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis), had the largest foraging ranges (maximum ranges {\textgreater}330, 590 and 580. km, respectively), whereas red-throated diver (Gavia stellata) and little tern (Sternula albifrons) had the smallest (maximum ranges 9 and 11. km, respectively). Representative foraging ranges may be useful to suggest likely colony-specific foraging areas, prior to habitat-association modelling for defining candidate MPAs. The approach here has international applicability, and would help progress towards more comprehensive protection of seabird populations. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The six methods are tested using simulations based on data for two data-rich Alaskan crab stocks and are applied to data for six Alaskan crab stocks. The results suggest that, unlike stock status relative to the unfished level and Maximum Sustainable Yield, estimates of EMSYand BMSYare generally poor, with poor performance attributed mainly to production models ignoring transient age and size dynamics, and the impact of data contrast as well as the extent of process and observation error. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Since its development in the early 1980s, the mass-balance approach incorporated in the Ecopath software has been widely used for constructing food-web models of marine and other ecosystems. Generalizations on the structure and functioning of such ecosystems, relevant to the issue of fisheries impacts, have been developed and these have affected the evolution of the Ecopath approach. Thus, the description of the average state of an ecosystem, using Ecopath proper, now serves to parametrize systems of coupled difference and differential equations, which are used to depict changes in biomasses and trophic interactions in time (Ecosim) and space (Ecospace). The outcomes of these simulations can then be used to modify the initial parametriz- ation, and the simulations are rerun until external validation is achieved. This reconceptualization of the Ecopath approach as an iterative process, which helps address issues of structural uncertainty, does not increase its input requirements markedly. Rather, it has become possible, through a Bayesian resampling routine, to explicitly consider the numerical uncertainty associated with these inputs. We present the key features of the reconceptualized approach, and two indices based thereon for quantifying the ecosystem impacts of fisheries. We conclude with a brief discussion of its limitations, both present and intrinsic.},

A model of primary production is introduced in order to make possible an account of nutricnt circlliation (as examplified by phosphorus) within and nutrient flow through the system. It is demonstrated in an application to North Sea fishencs that recent changes in total yield can be described in some detail under the terms of the model as a function of fishing mortality alone. The composition of the North Sea fauna in the virgin state is discussed and also the conditions under which total yield could be increased above the 1970 level.},

abstract = {An experimental evaluation of the effect of sheephead (Semicossyphus pulcher) predation on red sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) was initiated at San Nicolas Island, California in Sept. 1980. All sheephead (N=220) were removed from an area of approximately 12,700 m2 and subsequent changes in sea urchin numbers and microhabitat utilization were monitored along permanent transects for 24 months. The sea urchins within the transects were also measured in situ to determine changes in the size frequency distribution of the population. Although sea urchins rank only seventh in relative importance in the sheephead's diet at San Nicolas Island, there has been a significant increase in sea urchin numbers in the experimental area (26{\%} increase/year) but there has been no change in the control site. Further, there has been a slight increase in the proportion of sea urchins occupying exposed versus sheltered microhabitats in the removal site. Changes in the size frequency distribution of the urchins were minimal (probably due to an observation period of only one year); the size frequency distribution was unimodal and skewed to the left, indicating weak recruitment of urchins. Comparisons of sheephead densities and the percent of sea urchins in exposed microhabitats (i.e. available to predation by sheephead) were also made at four areas around San Nicolas Island and three areas in Baja California. In areas with low sheephead densities (0-35/hectare) sea urchins were highly exposed, and in areas where sheephead densities were high (200-500/hectare), no urchins were exposed. This study demonstrates that sheephead are capable of regulating the density and microhabitat distribution of sea urchin populations. These results are discussed in relation to other factors which may affect sea urchin populations.},

abstract = {The Marine Life Management Act (MLMA), which became law on Jan. 1, 1999, opened a new era in the management and conserva- tion of living marine resources in California. The MLMA's overriding goal is to ensure the conservation, sustainable use, and restoration of California's living marine resources, including the conservation of healthy and diverse marine ecosystems and living marine resources. To achieve this goal, the MLMA established an innovative program for managing marine sheries. Good sheries managers periodically take stock of the effectiveness of their programs. With this in mind, the MLMA requires that the Department prepare an annual report on the status of sport and commercial marine sheries managed by the state. The MLMA requires that these reports do three things: 1) identify any marine shery that does not meet the MLMA's sustainability policies; 2) review restricted access programs; and 3) evaluate the management system and make recommendations for modications. This rst report presents the best available informa- tion for all marine and estuarine sheries managed by the state. Under the MLMA, later annual reports will cover one-quarter of all marine and estuarine sheries managed by the state. The rst section of California's Living Marine Resources: A Status Report is meant to provide lay people and specialists alike with the best available information on the oceanic, environmental, regula- tory, and socioeconomic factors that affect the management affecting California's living marine resources. This discussion is divided into ve chapters: California's Variable Ocean Environment, The Status of Habitats and Water Quality in California's Coastal and Marine Environ- ment, The Human Ecosystem Dimension, The Status of Marine Fisher- ies Law Enforcement and A Review of Restricted Access Programs. The second section of the report includes chapters on the three major ecosystems off California: nearshore, offshore, and bays and estuaries. Each of these chapters includes a description of the ecosystem, the major issues facing sheries managers, and the management frame- work. These chapters also include evaluations of individual sheries and species of marine wildlife, including a historical description of each shery, the status of biological knowledge, and the status of the population. Management considerations submitted by authors for approximately half the individual sheries are found in Appendix A. The report concludes with chapters on Aquaculture, Invasive Species, and Marine Birds and Mammals.},

abstract = {The separation of the effects of environmental variability from the impacts of fishing has been elusive, but is essential for sound fisheries management. We distinguish environmental effects from fishing effects by comparing the temporal variability of exploited versus unexploited fish stocks living in the same environments. Using the unique suite of 50-year-long larval fish surveys from the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations we analyse fishing as a treatment effect in a long-term ecological experiment. Here we present evidence from the marine environment that exploited species exhibit higher temporal variability in abundance than unexploited species. This remains true after accounting for life-history effects, abundance, ecological traits and phylogeny. The increased variability of exploited populations is probably caused by fishery-induced truncation of the age structure, which reduces the capacity of populations to buffer environmental events. Therefore, to avoid collapse, fisheries must be managed not only to sustain the total viable biomass but also to prevent the significant truncation of age structure. The double jeopardy of fishing to potentially deplete stock sizes and, more immediately, to amplify the peaks and valleys of population variability, calls for a precautionary management approach.},

In early 2011, the marine ecosystems along the west coast of Australia—a global hotspot of biodiversity and endemism4, 5—experienced the highest-magnitude warming event on record. Sea temperatures soared to unprecedented levels and warming anomalies of 2–4 °C persisted for more than ten weeks along {\textgreater}2,000 km of coastline. We show that biodiversity patterns of temperate seaweeds, sessile invertebrates and demersal fish were significantly different after the warming event, which led to a reduction in the abundance of habitat-forming seaweeds and a subsequent shift in community structure towards a depauperate state and a tropicalization of fish communities. We conclude that extreme climatic events are key drivers of biodiversity patterns and that the frequency and intensity of such episodes have major implications for predictive models of species distribution and ecosystem structure, which are largely based on gradual warming trends.},

abstract = {Community interactions alter the management actions necessary to recover overfished species using marine reserves. For example, in communities where a larger species preys on their juveniles' competitors, overfishing of the larger species may cause prey population expansion; subsequent increased competition for the juveniles of the over fished species may impede its recovery within reserves. We explore the implications of such community interactions for reserve design with a model of a subtidal rockfish (genus Sebastes) system from the Northeast Pacific Ocean within a no-take reserve. Ignoring community interactions, the model predicts that a reserve large enough for internal recruitment to counterbalance mortality will allow recovery of the overfished species. However, after incorporating community interactions, the model predicts that two alternative stable states exist: one where the overfished species dominates and one where the prey dominates. In the community model, the ability of an overfished system to recover to the equilibrium where the overfished species dominates after reserve establishment depends on the initial densities of both species, and a larger reserve is required for recovery to be possible.},

The Fur Seal Treaty of 1911 (abrogated in 1941) protected sea otters in international waters, but was not applicable to most sea otter habitats and failed to terminate all legal sea otter harvests. Between 1941 and 1972 only the State of California was consistently engaged in sea otter conservation, based on a 1913 state law. Trends in cultural values toward protection of species based on imperiled status rather than economics led to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (1972), giving sea otters unambiguous protection in all US territorial waters. Sea otter habitat protection by the US government began in the 1890s. State marine protected areas potentially support sea otter conservation, particularly when paired with adjacent federal protected entities in or near sea otter habitat.},

abstract = {Abstract: There is a growing recognition that conservation often entails trade-offs. A focus on trade-offs can open the way to more complete consideration of the variety of positive and negative effects associated with conservation initiatives. In analyzing and working through conservation trade-offs, however, it is important to embrace the complexities inherent in the social context of conservation. In particular, it is important to recognize that the consequences of conservation activities are experienced, perceived, and understood differently from different perspectives, and that these perspectives are embedded in social systems and preexisting power relations. We illustrate the role of trade-offs in conservation and the complexities involved in understanding them with recent debates surrounding REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation), a global conservation policy designed to create incentives to reduce tropical deforestation. Often portrayed in terms of the multiple benefits it may provide: poverty alleviation, biodiversity conservation, and climate-change mitigation; REDD may involve substantial trade-offs. The gains of REDD may be associated with a reduction in incentives for industrialized countries to decrease carbon emissions; relocation of deforestation to places unaffected by REDD; increased inequality in places where people who make their livelihood from forests have insecure land tenure; loss of biological and cultural diversity that does not directly align with REDD measurement schemes; and erosion of community-based means of protecting forests. We believe it is important to acknowledge the potential trade-offs involved in conservation initiatives such as REDD and to examine these trade-offs in an open and integrative way that includes a variety of tools, methods, and points of view.},

We also quantified interspecific and intraspecific interactions among nine subtidal canopy seaweed species across three continents to examine the general nature of interactions in subtidal systems under low consumer pressure. We reveal that positive and neutral interactions are widespread throughout global seaweed communities and the nature of interactions can change from competitive to facilitative with increasing light stress in shallow marine systems.

abstract = {Understanding species distributions and their community structure is increasingly important when taking an ecosystem-based approach to conservation and management. However, knowledge of the distribution and community structure of species in mid-range trophic levels (e.g. macroinvertebrates) is lacking in most marine ecosystems. Our study aimed to examine the spatial distribution and community-level biogeographic patterns of common kelp forest–rocky reef macroinvertebrates in Southern California and to evaluate the effects of environmental gradients on these communities. Quantitative SCUBA surveys were used to estimate macroinvertebrate densities at 92 sites from 2008–2012. Non-metric multidimensional scaling was used to evaluate spatial patterns of macroinvertebrate communities among Regions. We found that kelp forest–rocky reef macroinvertebrate communities are distinct among different island and mainland regions, and their community patterns exhibited a strong relationship with an environmental gradient (i.e. sea surface temperature) even after controlling for geographic distance between sites. High abundances of urchin species (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) were strong drivers of regional differences. Macroinvertebrate community patterns were driven by characteristic species that were typically more prevalent at warmer or colder sites. Our results provide the first quantitative analysis of macroinvertebrate community structure within the California kelp forest ecosystem. We also describe the distribution and abundance of 92 conspicuous kelp forest-rocky reef macroinvertebrates among nine pre-defined Regions. This study provides important preliminary information on these macroinvertebrate species that will be directly useful to inform management of invertebrate fisheries and spatial protection of marine resources.},

abstract = {Stakeholders increasingly expect ecosystem assessments as part of advice on fisheries management. Quantitative models to support fisheries decision-making may be either strategic (‘big picture', direction-setting and contextual) or tactical (focused on management actions on short timescales), with some strategic models informing the development of tactical models. We describe and review ‘Models of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem assessments' (MICE) that have a tactical focus, including use as ecosystem assessment tools. MICE are context- and question-driven and limit complexity by restricting the focus to those components of the ecosystem needed to address the main effects of the management question under consideration. Stakeholder participation and dialogue is an integral part of this process. MICE estimate parameters through fitting to data, use statistical diagnostic tools to evaluate model performance and account for a broad range of uncertainties. These models therefore address many of the impediments to greater use of ecosystem models in strategic and particularly tactical decision-making for marine resource management and conservation. MICE are capable of producing outputs that could be used for tactical decision-making, but our summary of existing models suggests this has not occurred in any meaningful way to date.

abstract = {Spatial variability can confound accurate estimates of catch per unit effort (CPUE), especially in highly migratory species. The incorporation of spatial struc- ture into fishery stock assessment models should ultimately improve forecasts of stock biomass. Here, we describe a nonlinear time series model for produc- ing spatially explicit forecasts of CPUE that does not require ancillary environmental or demographic data, or specification of a model functional form. We dem- onstrate this method using spatially resolved (1° 9 1° cells) CPUE time series of North Pacific albacore in the California Current System. The spatial model is highly significant (P {\textless} 0.00001) and outperforms two spatial null models. We then create a spatial forecast map for years beyond the range of data. Such approaches can guide spatial management of resources and provide a complement to more data-intensive, highly parameterized population dynamics and ecosys- tem models currently in use.},

abstract = {Future CO 2 -induced climate change scenarios from Global Circulation Models (GCMs) indicate increasing air temperatures, with the greatest warming in the Arctic and Subarctic. Changes to the wind fields and precipitation patterns are also suggested. These will lead to changes in the hydrographic properties of the ocean, as well as the vertical stratification and circulation patterns. Of particular note is the expected increase in ocean temperature. Based upon the observed responses of cod to temperature variability, the expected responses of cod stocks throughout the North Atlantic to the future temperature scenarios are reviewed and discussed here. Stocks in the Celtic and Irish Seas are expected to disappear under predicted temperature changes by the year 2100, while those in the southern North Sea and Georges Bank will decline. Cod will likely spread northwards along the coasts of Greenland and Labrador, occupy larger areas of the Barents Sea, and may even extend onto some of the continental shelves of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, spawning sites will be established further north than currently. It is likely that spring migrations will occur earlier, and fall returns will be later. There is the distinct possibility that, where seasonal sea ice disappears altogether, cod will cease their migration. Individual growth rates for many of the cod stocks will increase, leading to an overall increase in the total production of Atlantic cod in the North Atlantic. These responses of cod to future climate changes are highly uncertain, however, as they will also depend on the changes to climate and oceanographic variables besides temperature, such as plankton production, the prey and predator fields, and industrial fishing. {\textcopyright} 2005 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

abstract = {Predicting responses of complex ecosystems to environmental impacts is challenging because of the web of species interactions and their potential to generate indirect effects. Multispecies Markov chain models provide one potential predictive framework for complex ecosystems. A previously parameterized Markov model of a rocky intertidal community predicted little effect of removing acorn barnacles from the system on sessile species composition. In contrast, short-term observations of recovery following disturbance suggest that acorn barnacles play a key facilitation role in mussel-bed recovery. In a 6-yr experiment in which balanoid acorn barnacles [Balanus glandula Darwin, 1854 and Semibalanus cariosus (Pallas, 1788)] were chronically and selectively removed, final species composition did not differ significantly from that of model predictions (90.3{\%} of mean composition explained, P {\textgreater} 0.5), and the mussel Mytilus californianus Conrad, 1837 was able to attain its typical dominance. These results demonstrate that multispecies Markov chain models can generate reliable predictions and that acorn-barnacle facilitation does not have a substantial effect on long-term community composition in this system.},

abstract = {We provide a broad overview of the underlying philosophy of ecological monitoring. We argue that the major characteristics of effective monitoring programs typically include: (1) Good questions. (2) A conceptual model of an ecosystem or population. (3) Strong partnerships between scientists, policy-makers and managers. (4) Frequent use of data collected. We classify monitoring programs into three categories - (1) Passive monitoring, which is devoid of specified questions or underlying study design and has limited rationale other than curiosity. (2) Mandated monitoring where environmental data are gathered as a stipulated requirement of government legislation or a political directive. The focus is usually to identify trends. (3) Question-driven monitoring, which is guided by a conceptual model and by a rigorous design that will typically result in a priori predictions that can be tested. There are advantages and disadvantages of mandated monitoring programs, which are typically large-scaled, and generally smaller-scaled, question-driven monitoring programs. For example, while question-driven monitoring programs can provide insights into the ecological processes giving rise to emergent environmental patterns, spatial generalization from them is difficult because results may not extrapolate well to other regions, states or to a national level. Conversely, while mandated monitoring can be useful for producing coarse level summaries of temporal changes in a target population or resource condition they may not identify the mechanism influencing a change in an ecosystem or an entity. A key remaining challenge is to develop much improved mandated monitoring programs through more widespread adoption of the features of successful question-driven monitoring programs in efforts to enhance biodiversity conservation and environmental management. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

We compared the responses of herbivore and plant communities to predator manipulations in 102 field experiments in six different ecosystems: lentic ( lake and pond), marine, and stream benthos, lentic and marine plankton, and terrestrial (grasslands and agricultural fields). Predator effects varied considerably among systems and were strongest in lentic and marine benthos and weakest in marine plankton and terrestrial food webs. Predator effects on herbivores were generally larger and more variable than on plants, suggesting that cascades often become attenuated at the plant– herbivore interface. Top-down control of plant biomass was stronger in water than on land; however, the differences among the five aquatic food webs were as great as those between wet and dry systems.},

abstract = {The usefulness and relevance of size-based indicators (SBIs) to an ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) are assessed through a review of empirical and modelling studies. SBIs are tabulated along with their definitions, data requirements, potential biases, availability of time-series, and expected directions of change in response to fishing pressure. They include mean length in a population, mean length in a community, mean maximum length in a community, and the slope and intercept of size spectra. Most SBIs can be derived from fairly standard survey data on length frequencies, without the need for elaborate models. Possible fishing- and environment-induced effects are analysed to distinguish between the two causes, and hypothetical cases of reference directions of change are tabulated. We conclude that no single SBI can serve as an effective overall indicator of heavy fishing pressure. Rather, suites of SBI should be selected, and reference directions may be more useful than reference points. Further modelling and worldwide comparative studies are needed to provide better understanding of SBIs and the factors affecting them. The slow response to fishing pressure reflects the complexity of community interactions and ecosystem responses, and prohibits their application in the context of short-term (annual) tactical fisheries management. However, movement towards longer-term (5-10 years) strategic management in EAF should facilitate their use. {\textcopyright} 2005 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

abstract = {Species targeted by fishing often recover in abundance and size within marine protected areas (MPAs) resulting in increased reproductive potential. However, in some situations, concomitant changes in the abundance of predators, competitors, or prey within MPAs, or strong gradients in the surrounding environmental seascape may counteract the purported benefits making it more difficult to predict how species will respond to protection. We used a network of MPAs in California, spanning a large temperature gradient, to investigate the drivers of demographic variability in the commercially important red sea urchin Mesocentrotus franciscanus. We investigated how demographic metrics varied geographically in response to protection, temperature, and the main sea urchin resource, the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera. We found significant conservation benefits to this fished sea urchin within MPAs designated six years prior to the beginning of this study. Within MPAs, red sea urchins were generally larger resulting in greater adult biomass density and reproductive biomass density. In addition, kelp density was an important explanatory variable of all red sea urchin demographic traits examined (adult size, gonadosomatic index [GSI], density, adult biomass density, and reproductive biomass density). Kelp density was positively correlated with red sea urchin GSI and adult size, but the relationships with density, adult biomass density, and reproductive biomass density were complex and the directionality changed depending on the region (or environmental setting) examined. Our results demonstrate that kelp, red sea urchin reproduction, and the effects of spatial management on demographic processes are tightly coupled with the oceanographic regime.},

Over the past three decades, ecologists and economists around the world have been examining the existence and use of 'ecological thresholds' in natural and modified systems, primarily as a conceptual basis for the development of tools to conserve and sustainably manage natural resources. In Australia, there has been a recent renewed interest in the definition and application of ecological thresholds in the conservation of threatened fauna and flora, modelling the impact of habitat loss, modification and fragmentation on terrestrial biota, management of pest plant and animal species, and development of natural resource management policies and plans. This paper reviews the threshold concept from an ecological perspective. It considers the definition, types and behaviour of this phenomenon. The theoretical and empirical evidence for their purported existence is reviewed and their potential utility in biodiversity conservation and natural resource management is discussed, along with key issues relating to their use. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Strong top-down control by grazers is considered a moderating influence on the negative effects of elevated nutrients on marine algae. Little experimental work has been done in a system that has weak grazing pressure (weak top-down control), which is also subjected to elevated nutrients. We experimentally elevated nutrient concentration to test (1) the effects of nutrient enrichment on algal assemblages in the presence and absence of canopies (Ecklonia radiata) and (2) the interactive effects of nutrients and molluscan grazers (meso-grazers) on algal assemblages in the absence of canopies. We established that the loss of canopy-forming algae is likely to be a key precursor to nutrient-driven changes of assemblages of benthic algae, because nutrients had no effects on algal assemblages in the presence of canopy-forming algae. In the absence of canopy-forming algae, space was monopolised by filamentous, turf-forming algae, and it was only in the presence of grazers that nutrients caused a change to the relative covers of algal habitat that monopolise canopy-free space. When grazers were present at natural densities, elevated nutrients reduced the monopoly of turf-forming algae in favour of foliose algae. These results demonstrate a novel interaction between nutrients (bottom-up control) and grazing pressure (top-down control), which are fundamental to predictions about management of human activities that continue to reduce densities of herbivores and increase nutrient availability on temperate coasts.},

abstract = {The ‘‘plaice box'' is a partially closed area in the North Sea, established in 1989 to reduce the discarding of undersized plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) in the main nursery areas, and thereby to enhance recruitment to the fishery. In contrast to the expected positive effects, yield and spawning stock biomass have decreased. The effects of the plaice box are evaluated by analyzing the relevant factors and processes (natural and anthropogenic) that affect recruitment. It is shown that the Dutch beam trawl effort has decreased in two phases. During 1989–1993, when the plaice box was closed only during the second and third quarter, effort was reduced to around 40{\%} of the original level. When the box was also closed in the fourth (1994) and first quarter (1995 onwards), effort decreased to around 6{\%}. The effort reduction would imply a reduction in discard mortality if all other factors had remained constant. However, a reduced growth rate and possibly a higher rate of natural mortality may have counteracted the reduction in fishing effort. The apparent changes in growth and mortality coincided with changes in the North Sea ecosystem that occurred in the early 1990s but may also be related to a response to the change in beam trawl effor},

abstract = {Sea otters Enhydra Iutris were re-introduced into coastal waters of British Columbia, Canada, in 1969-1972, after being hunted to extinction In the previous 2 centuries. In 1979, we visited an area where 55 individuals had been seen in 1978, and we made subtidal observations of the abundance and distribution of red sea urchins, other grazers, and kelps. Earlier observations, made in the area before sea otters were re-introduced, confirmed that changes have taken place in subtidal communities since the re-introduction. Where sea otters had been observed feeding, sea urchins Strongylocentrotus franciscanus were scarce and restricted to crevices or beneath boulders, other grazers were scarce, and kelps colonized the bottom to 10-m depths. The algal communities in these areas appeared to be simple downward extensions of sublittoral fringe communities. Where sea otters had not fed, kelps were limited to shallow water by abundant sea urchins. The observed differences between the 2 types of areas are concluded to have been caused by early ellmlnation of sea urchins by sea otters, as reported in Alaska and California. From the pattern of sea urchin abundance in the general area of the transplant, we were able to delineate the feeding range of this small population of sea otters. INTRODUCTION},

abstract = {As marine management measures increasingly protect static areas of the oceans, it is important to make sure protected areas capture and protect persistent populations and habitats. Rocky reefs in many temperate areas worldwide serve as habitat for canopy forming macroalgae and, in turn, these structure forming species of kelps (order Laminariales) often serve as important habitat for a great diversity of species. Macrocystis pyrifera is the most common canopy forming kelp species found along the coast of California but the distribution and abundance of M. pyrifera varies in space and time. The purpose of this study was to determine the relative contribution of various environmental parameters in predicting the spatial and temporal persistence of M. pyrifera along the central coast of California. Nine environmental variables considered in this study included depth of the seafloor, structure of the rocky reef, proportion of rocky reef, size of kelp patch, biomass of kelp within a patch, distance from the ed...},

abstract = {Physiological increases in energy expenditure frequently occur in response to environmental stress. Although energy limitation is often invoked as a basis for decreased calcification under ocean acidification, energy-relevant measurements related to this process are scant. In this study we focus on first-shell (prodissoconch I) formation in larvae of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. The energy cost of calcification was empirically derived to be ≤ 1.1 µJ (ng CaCO3)−1. Regardless of the saturation state of aragonite (2.77 vs. 0.77), larvae utilize the same amount of total energy to complete first-shell formation. Even though there was a 56{\%} reduction of shell mass and an increase in dissolution at aragonite undersaturation, first-shell formation is not energy limited because sufficient endogenous reserves are available to meet metabolic demand. Further studies were undertaken on larvae from genetic crosses of pedigreed lines to test for variance in response to aragonite undersaturation. Larval families show variation in response to ocean acidification, with loss of shell size ranging from no effect to 28{\%}. These differences show that resilience to ocean acidification may exist among genotypes. Combined studies of bioenergetics and genetics are promising approaches for understanding climate change impacts on marine organisms that undergo calcification.},

abstract = {Failure to account for interactions between endangered species may lead to unexpected population dynamics, inefficient management strategies, waste of scarce resources, and, at worst, increased extinction risk. The importance of species interactions is undisputed, yet recovery targets generally do not account for such interactions. This shortcoming is a consequence of species-centered legislation, but also of uncertainty surrounding the dynamics of species interactions and the complexity of modeling such interactions. The northern sea otter (Enhydra lutris kenyoni) and one of its preferred prey, northern abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana), are endangered species for which recovery strategies have been developed without consideration of their strong predator-prey interactions. Using simulation-based optimization procedures from artificial intelligence, namely reinforcement learning and stochastic dynamic programming, we combined sea otter and northern abalone population models with functional-response models and examined how different management actions affect population dynamics and the likelihood of achieving recovery targets for each species through time. Recovery targets for these interacting species were difficult to achieve simultaneously in the absence of management. Although sea otters were predicted to recover, achieving abalone recovery targets failed even when threats to abalone such as predation and poaching were reduced. A management strategy entailing a 50{\%} reduction in the poaching of northern abalone was a minimum requirement to reach short-term recovery goals for northern abalone when sea otters were present. Removing sea otters had a marginally positive effect on the abalone population but only when we assumed a functional response with strong predation pressure. Our optimization method could be applied more generally to any interacting threatened or invasive species for which there are multiple conservation objectives.},

We found that (i) a suite of metrics is required to accurately characterize ecosystem status and, conversely, that focusing on a few metrics may be misleading; (ii) assessment of ecosystem status is feasible for marine ecosystems; (iii) multivariate points of reference can be determined for EBFM; and (iv) the concept of reference directions could provide an ecosystem level analog to single-species reference points.},

In addition, it offers easy access to parallel computations. The user defines the joint likelihood for the data and the random effects as a C++ template function, while all the other operations are done in R; e.g., reading in the data. The package evaluates and maximizes the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood where the random effects are automatically integrated out. This approximation, and its derivatives, are obtained using automatic differentiation (up to order three) of the joint likelihood. The computations are designed to be fast for problems with many random effects ({\~{}}10{\^{}}6) and parameters ({\~{}}10{\^{}}3). Computation times using ADMB and TMB are compared on a suite of examples ranging from simple models to large spatial models where the random effects are a Gaussian random field. Speedups ranging from 1.5 to about 100 are obtained with increasing gains for large problems. The package and examples are available at http://tmb-project.org.},

@article{Hutchings2015,
abstract = {Studies on small and declining populations dominate research in conservation biology. This emphasis reflects two overarching frameworks: the small-population paradigm focuses on correlates of increased extinction probability; the declining-population paradigm directs attention to the causes and consequences of depletion. Neither, however, particularly informs research on the determinants, rate or uncertainty of population increase. By contrast, Allee effects (positive associations between population size and realized per capita population growth rate, rrealized, a metric of average individual fitness) offer a theoretical and empirical basis for identifying numerical and temporal thresholds at which recovery is unlikely or uncertain. Following a critique of studies on Allee effects, I quantify population-size minima and subsequent trajectories of marine fishes that have and have not recovered following threat mitigation. The data suggest that threat amelioration, albeit necessary, can be insufficient to effect recovery for populations depleted to less than 10{\%} of maximum abundance (Nmax), especially when they remain depleted for lengthy periods of time. Comparing terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates, life-history analyses suggest that population-size thresholds for impaired recovery are likely to be comparatively low for marine fishes but high for marine mammals. Articulation of a  recovering population paradigm' would seem warranted. It might stimulate concerted efforts to identify generic impaired recovery thresholds across species. It might also serve to reduce the confusion of terminology, and the conflation of causes and consequences with patterns currently evident in the literature on Allee effects, thus strengthening communication among researchers and enhancing the practical utility of recovery-oriented research to conservation practitioners and resource managers.},

We compared patterns of predation by contemporary hunters and fishers with those of other predators that compete over shared prey (terrestrial mammals and marine fishes). Our global survey (2125 estimates of annual finite exploitation rate) revealed that humans kill adult prey, the reproductive capital of populations, at much higher median rates than other predators (up to 14 times higher), with particularly intense exploitation of terrestrial carnivores and fishes. Given this competitive dominance, impacts on predators, and other unique predatory behavior, we suggest that humans function as an unsustainable "super predator," which--unless additionally constrained by managers--will continue to alter ecological and evolutionary processes globally.},

In addition, recovery can take many decades for long-lived species and complex ecosystems. Major drivers of recovery include the reduction of human impacts, especially exploitation, habitat loss and pollution, combined with favorable life-history and environmental conditions.

abstract = {Globally, many fish species are overexploited, and many stocks have collapsed. This crisis, along with increasing concerns over flow-on effects on ecosystems, has caused a reevaluation of traditional fisheries management practices, and a new ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) paradigm has emerged. As part of this approach, selective fishing is widely encouraged in the belief that nonselective fishing has many adverse impacts. In particular, incidental bycatch is seen as wasteful and a negative feature of fishing, and methods to reduce bycatch are implemented in many fisheries. However, recent advances in fishery science and ecology suggest that a selective approach may also result in undesirable impacts both to fisheries and marine ecosystems. Selective fishing applies one or more of the "6-S" selections: species, stock, size, sex, season, and space. However, selective fishing alters biodiversity, which in turn changes ecosystem functioning and may affect fisheries production, hindering rather than helping achieve the goals of EBFM. We argue here that a "balanced exploitation" approach might alleviate many of the ecological effects of fishing by avoiding intensive removal of particular components of the ecosystem, while still supporting sustainable fisheries. This concept may require reducing exploitation rates on certain target species or groups to protect vulnerable components of the ecosystem. Benefits to society could be maintained or even increased because a greater proportion of the entire suite of harvested species is used.},

abstract = {Ecosystem-orientated thinking is increasingly incorporated into fishery management. Given the complexity of ecosystem processes, there is a need to evaluate the tools used to steer this thinking critically. ECOPATH with ECOSIM (EwE), an aggregate system-modelling package, is currently the most widely employed approach to assess the ecosystem effects of fishing. The basic equations and assumptions, strengths and weaknesses, and the potential of this approach to contribute to practical fisheries management advice are reviewed. Strengths include the structured parameterization framework, the inclusion of a well-balanced level of conceptual realism, a novel representation of predator-prey interaction terms, and the inclusion of a Bayes-like approach (ECORANGER) to take account of the uncertainty associated with values for model inputs. Weaknesses in model structure include the constraining nature of the mass-balance assumption (of ECOPATH) for initiating projections, the questionable handling of life history responses such as compensatory changes in the natural mortality rates of marine mammals, overcompensatory stock-recruit relationships that result from default parameter settings, possible problems in extrapolating from the microscale to the macroscale, as well as some (not too far-reaching) mathematical inconsistencies in the underlying equations. There is a paucity of systematic and stepwise investigations into model behaviour and properties, and users are cautioned against non-critical use of the default settings. An important limitation related to the predominant use of EwE as a "black-box" modelling tool is that some users fail to consider a range of alternative interaction representations. As with all multispecies approaches, the major limitation in applying the EwE approach lies in the quality and quantity of available data. Current EwE applications generally do not adequately address uncertainty in data inputs and model structure. Prudent EwE applications that utilize good data and are based upon rigorous statistical analyses can complement the quantitative predictions of traditional single-species models. They could be particularly useful in some contexts if output in the form of probability distributions encompassing a range of likely ecosystem responses were to be coupled with attempts to extend Operational Management Procedure (OMP) approaches to fisheries management beyond the singlespecies level. In particular, such applications could serve as the operating models of the underlying dynamics that are used for computer simulation testing of OMPs.},

Stress/disturbance gradient models of community organization, such as the stress gradient hypothesis, emphasize a diminished role for competition in harsh environments wherea modern coexistence theory does not. Confusion about the role of species interactions in harsh environments is perpetuated by a disconnect between population dynamics theory and data. We linked theory and data using response surface experiments done in the field to parametrize mathematical, population-dynamic competition models. We replicated our experiment across two environments that spanned a common and important environmental stress gradient for determining community structure in benthic marine systems. We generated quantitative estimates of the effects of environmental stress on population growth rates and the directioni and strength of intra and interspecific interacctions within each environment. Our approach directly addressed a perpetual blind spot in this field by showing how the effects of competition can be intensified in stressful environments even though the apparent strength of competition remains unchanged. Furthemmore, we showed how simultaneous, reciprocal competitive and factilitative effects can stabilitze population dynamics in multispecies communities in stressful environments.},

This sensitivity to structural assumptions warns us about possible mistakes that can arise in much more complex and realistic models, where we have to make equivalent assumptions. Recruitment limitation implies risk of depensatory impact on forage species as fishing rate on these species increases, with attendant risk of development of predator-prey cycles and strong responses to relatively small changes in basic forage fish productivity due to environmental factors.},

abstract = {1. A method for finding the consequences of long-term generalized press perturbations in multispecies ecological communities, with relatively modest requirements for data, is explicated. The approach uses energetic and allometric reasoning to set some parameter values for which data are not available. The remaining unknown parameters are treated as random variables, enabling the calculation of probability distributions for the outcomes that are of interest. 2. The method is used to investigate the effect of a cull of fur seals on fisheries in the Benguela ecosystem, using a 29-species foodweb for that system. In the case of Cape fur seals treated here, it is found that a cull of seals is more likely to be detrimental to total yields from all exploited species than it is to be beneficial. 3. The influence of weak links on the effects of a cull is investigated. Using both consumption by each species and consumption of each species to define link strength, a clear threshold in link strength is found, indicating that 44{\%} of all links could be deleted from the foodweb without affecting the predictions significantly. Even using a criterion based on consumption by each species alone (conventional dietary proportion data), about the same number of links can be deleted without seriously affecting the predictions of the model. This is a very helpful (and encouraging) result for the design of an observational protocol for systematic efforts to gather data for multispecies modelling.},

abstract = {Construction of annual indices of stock abundance based on the standardisation of catch and effort data remains central to many fisheries assessments. However, while the use of advanced statistical methods has helped catch rates to be standardised accounting for many explanatory variables, some of the more routine aspects of constructing abundance indices, such as how the index is constructed from the model parameters, receives little explanation in many analyses. This has lead to a lack of understanding as to how the indices are constructed and in some instances incorrect techniques have been applied. This lack of understanding can be a particular issue when interactions are used in the standardising model, especially those which contain interactions with the temporal effects over which the time-series of the abundance index is required. Other issues include the use of weighted model fits, the influence of anomalous data values, how best to impute missing values when required, the consequences of model mis-specification, and the use of random-effects. In this study, the basic approach for constructing abundance indices is outlined and a worked example using simulated data is presented to explore the nature of these issues and several techniques are suggested for dealing with them and to overcome potential biases. Finally, the methods presently used by ICCAT scientists for constructing abundance indices are reviewed. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Ecological influences of more than 90{\%} of the 338 known species of extant ocean megafauna are unstudied and thus unknown. The most widely known effect of those few species that have been studied is direct prey limitation, which occurs through consumption and risk avoidance behavior. Consumer-prey interactions result in indirect effects that extend through marine ecosystems to other species and ecological processes. Marine megafauna transport energy, nutrients, and other materials vertically and horizontally through the oceans, often over long distances. The functional relationships between these various ecological impacts and megafauna population densities, in the few well-studied cases, are characterized by phase shifts and hysteresis.},

abstract = {The sea otter was driven to the brink of extinction in the North Pacific by the early 1900s as a result of excessive hunting. Early laws and regulations that prohibited or regulated hunting of sea otters did have an effect where they were enacted early enough and could be enforced. Conversely, where laws were absent, extirpation occurred. The successful reintroduction of sea otters to unoccupied portions of their historic range during the late 1960s and 1970s in Canada and the United States was a significant conservation achievement made during a period of increasing concern for wildlife species and habitat loss. Protecting habitat has been an important conservation tool to retain portions of intact ecosystems and has been effective for many species. For sea otters, however, most habitats remain relatively unchanged by human activities. Rather, threats such as oil spills, entanglement, fisheries conflicts, and illegal killing demonstrate that conservation efforts need to continually adapt to address current and emerging issues through management of human activities. The Species at Risk Act has done much for the recovery and conservation of sea otters in Canada, most particularly by establishing a requirement for an empirical science-based approach to recovery and by clarifying the obligations of government agencies to support these efforts. Although there is broad recognition in conservation of the importance of species interactions in shaping ecological communities, endangered species legislation in Canada (Species at Risk Act, 2003) and in the United States (Endangered Species Act, 1973) continues to follow primarily a single-species listing and recovery approach. When conservation is needed for both a strongly interacting predator and a prey species and where the prey is of value to commercial fisheries, as is the case with sea otters and abalone, the divergent objectives of conservation and fisheries present challenges for conservation.},

abstract = {The strength of interactions between predators and their prey (interaction strength) varies enormously among species within ecological communities. Understanding the community-wide distribution of interaction strengths is vital, given that communities dominated by weak interactions may be more stable and resistant to invasion. In the oceans, previous studies have reported log-normal distributions of per capita interaction strength. We estimated the distribution of predator-prey interaction strengths within a subtidal speciose herbivore community (45 species). Laboratory experiments were used to determine maximum per capita interaction strengths for eight species of herbivores (including amphipods, isopods, gastropods, and sea urchins) that graze on giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) microscopic stages. We found that maximum per capita interaction strength saturated as a function of individual herbivore biomass, likely caused by predator/prey size thresholds. Incorporating this nonlinearity, we predicted maximum per capita interaction strength for the remaining herbivore species. The resulting distribution of per capita interaction strengths was bimodal, in striking contrast to previous reports from other communities. Although small herbivores often had per capita interaction strengths similar to larger herbivores, their tendency to have greater densities in the field increased their potential impact as grazers. These results indicate that previous conclusions about the distributions of interaction strength in natural communities are not general, and that intermediate-sized predators can under realistic circumstances represent the most effective consumers in natural communities.},

The approach is based on typologies of fishing operations involving multivariate descriptive methods like factorial analyses and classification techniques. The obtained types of fishing operations are considered as fishing tactics. The approach is applied to two contrasting examples, a small-scale Senegalese fishery and a Celtic Sea fishery that operates at a larger scale. Catch per species and fishing effort are computed per tactic. Results emphasize the importance of fishing location and seasonal effects for characterizing fishing tactics.},

abstract = {Interactions between biotic and abiotic processes complicate the design and interpretation of ecological experiments. Separating causality from simple correlation requires distinguishing among experimental treatments, experimental responses, and the many processes and properties that are correlated with either the treatments or the responses, or both. When an experimental manipulation has multiple components, but only one of them is identified as the experimental treatment. erroneous conclusions about cause and effect relationships are likely because the actual cause of any observed response may be ignored in the interpretation of the experimental results. This unrecognized cause of an observed response can be considered a ''hidden treatment.'' Three types of hidden treatments are potential problems in biodiversity experiments: (1) abiotic conditions, such as resource levels, or biotic conditions, such as predation, which are intentionally or unintentionally altered in order to create differences in species numbers for ''diversity'' treatments; (2) non-random selection of species with particular attributes that produce treatment differences that exceed those due to ''diversity'' alone; and (3) the increased statistical probability of including a species with a dominant negative or positive effect (e.g., dense shade, or nitrogen fixation) in randomly selected groups of species of increasing number or ''diversity.'' In each of these cases, treatment responses that are actually the result of the ''hidden treatment'' may be inadvertently attributed to variation in species diversity. Case studies re-evaluating three different types of biodiversity experiments demonstrate that the increases found in such ecosystem properties as productivity, nutrient use efficiency, and stability (all of which were attributed to higher levels of species diversity) were actually caused by ''hidden trearments'' that altered plant biomass and productivity.},

Giant kelp has a positive, direct effect on local abundances of species that use it as a nursery ground and/or adult habitat. Kelp can also indirectly affect abundances offish. These indirect effects, which can be positive or negative, result from the shading of understory algae by kelp.

abstract = {Aim  The study and prediction of species–environment relationships is currently mainly based on species distribution models. These purely correlative models neglect spatial population dynamics and assume that species distributions are in equilibrium with their environment. This causes biased estimates of species niches and handicaps forecasts of range dynamics under environmental change. Here we aim to develop an approach that statistically estimates process-based models of range dynamics from data on species distributions and permits a more comprehensive quantification of forecast uncertainties. Innovation  We present an approach for the statistical estimation of process-based dynamic range models (DRMs) that integrate Hutchinson's niche concept with spatial population dynamics. In a hierarchical Bayesian framework the environmental response of demographic rates, local population dynamics and dispersal are estimated conditional upon each other while accounting for various sources of uncertainty. The method thus: (1) jointly infers species niches and spatiotemporal population dynamics from occurrence and abundance data, and (2) provides fully probabilistic forecasts of future range dynamics under environmental change. In a simulation study, we investigate the performance of DRMs for a variety of scenarios that differ in both ecological dynamics and the data used for model estimation. Main conclusions  Our results demonstrate the importance of considering dynamic aspects in the collection and analysis of biodiversity data. In combination with informative data, the presented framework has the potential to markedly improve the quantification of ecological niches, the process-based understanding of range dynamics and the forecasting of species responses to environmental change. It thereby strengthens links between biogeography, population biology and theoretical and applied ecology.},

JABBA presents a unifying, flexible framework for biomass dynamic modelling, runs quickly, and generates reproducible stock status estimates and diagnostic tools. Specific emphasis has been placed on flexibility for specifying alternative scenarios, achieving high stability and improved convergence rates. Default JABBA features include: 1) an integrated state-space tool for averaging and automatically fitting multiple catch per unit effort (CPUE) time series; 2) data-weighting through estimation of additional observation variance for individual or grouped CPUE; 3) selection of Fox, Schaefer, or Pella-Tomlinson production functions; 4) options to fix or estimate process and observation variance components; 5) model diagnostic tools; 6) future projections for alternative catch regimes; and 7) a suite of inbuilt graphics illustrating model fit diagnostics and stock status results.

The large differences in population fluctuations between the three small mammal species are related to differences in their respective feedback structures. The analyses reveal that per capita growth rate of the leaf-eared mouse is a decreasing function of log density and of log barn owl abundance together with a positive rainfall effect. In turn, per capita population growth rate (R-function) of the barn owl is a negative function of log barn owl abundance and a positive function of leaf-eared mouse abundance, suggesting a predator-prey interaction. The dramatic population fluctuations exhibited by leaf-eared mouse (Phyllotis darwini) are caused by climate effects coupled with a complex food web architecture.},

Recent methods (convergent cross mapping, CCM) have made substantial progress on this problem by applying the idea of nonlinear attractor reconstruction to time series data. Here, we expand upon the technique of CCM by explicitly considering time lags. Applying this extended method to representative examples (model simulations, a laboratory predator-prey experiment, temperature and greenhouse gas reconstructions from the Vostok ice core, and long-term ecological time series collected in the Southern California Bight), we demonstrate the ability to identify different time-delayed interactions, distinguish between synchrony induced by strong unidirectional-forcing and true bidirectional causality, and resolve transitive causal chains.},

abstract = {No-take marine reserves directly promote the recovery of predatory species, which can have negative indirect effects on prey populations in reserves. When harvesting also occurs on prey species there is potential conflict between the direct and indirect effects of protection, and reserves may not have conservation benefits for prey species. For example, sea urchins are fished in many regions, but may decline in reserves due to increased predation rates. To investigate this potential conflict, this paper compares density, size, biomass and reproductive potential of both a harvested and an unharvested urchin species between a long-term reserve and unprotected sites in California. Consistent with density-mediated indirect interactions, densities of the unharvested species were 3.4-times higher at unprotected sites compared to reserve sites. However, for the harvested species, densities were comparable between reserve and unprotected sites. Both species were consistently larger at reserve sites, and the biomass and reproductive potential of the harvested species was 4.8- and 7.0-times higher, respectively, than at unprotected sites. This is likely due to differences in size-selectivity between harvesting and predators, and potential compensatory effects of predators. While the generality of these effects needs to be tested, these results suggest mechanisms whereby reserves can benefit both predator and prey species.},

abstract = {This study uses a 30-year time series of standardized bottom trawl survey data (1982-2011) from the eastern Bering Sea shelf to model patterns of summer spatial distribution for various bottom fishes and crabs in response to changes in the areal extent of the cold pool, time lag between surveys, and fluctuations in population abundance. This investigation is the first to include data for the 2006-2010 cold period and to use between-year comparisons of local and shelf-wide spatial indices to test specific responses to three different isothermal boundaries within the cold pool. Distributional shifts in population varied considerably among species and directional vectors for some species were greater in magnitude to the east or west than to the north or south; however, in general, eastern Bering Sea shelf populations shifted southward in response to the increasing cold pool size, and after accounting for differences in temperature and population abundance, there was still a temporal northward shift in populations over the last three decades despite the recent cooling trend. Model results for local and shelf-wide indices showed that survey time lag and cold pool extent had a greater effect on spatial distribution than population abundance, suggesting that density-independent mechanisms play a major role in shaping distribution patterns on the eastern Bering Sea shelf. The area enclosed by the 1. °C isotherm most commonly affects both local and shelf-wide spatial indices suggesting that 1. °C is a more important boundary for describing temperature preferences of eastern Bering Sea bottom fishes and crabs than is the 2. °C isotherm used for designating the physical boundary for the cold pool. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {A key consideration in assessing impacts of climate change is the possibility of synergistic effects with other human-induced stressors. In the ocean realm, climate change and overfishing pose two of the greatest challenges to the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems. In eastern Tasmania, temperate coastal waters are warming at approximately four times the global ocean warming average, representing the fastest rate of warming in the Southern Hemisphere. This has driven range extension of the ecologically important long-spined sea urchin (Centrostephanus rodgersii), which has now commenced catastrophic overgrazing of productive Tasmanian kelp beds leading to loss of biodiversity and important rocky reef ecosystem services. Coincident with the overgrazing is heavy fishing of reef-based predators including the spiny lobster Jasus edwardsii. By conducting experiments inside and outside Marine Protected Areas we show that fishing, by removing large predatory lobsters, has reduced the resilience of kelp beds against the climate-driven threat of the sea urchin and thus increased risk of catastrophic shift to widespread sea urchin barrens. This shows that interactions between multiple human-induced stressors can exacerbate nonlinear responses of ecosystems to climate change and limit the adaptive capacity of these systems. Management actions focused on reducing the risk of catastrophic phase shift in ecosystems are particularly urgent in the face of ongoing warming and unprecedented levels of predator removal from the world's oceans.},

Effective marine ecosystem-based management (EBM) requires understanding the key processes and relationships controlling the aspects of biodiversity, productivity, and resilience to perturbations. Unfortunately, the scales, complexity, and non-linear dynamics that characterize marine ecosystems often confound managing for these properties. Nevertheless, scientifically derived decision-support tools (DSTs) are needed to account for impacts resulting from a variety of simultaneous human activities. Three possible methodologies for revealing mechanisms necessary to develop DSTs for EBM are: (i) controlled experimentation, (ii) iterative programmes of observation and modelling ("learning by doing"), and (iii) comparative ecosystem analysis. We have seen that controlled experiments are limited in capturing the complexity necessary to develop models of marine ecosystem dynamics with sufficient realism at appropriate scales. Iterative programmes of observation, model building, and assessment are useful for specific ecosystem issues but rarely lead to generally transferable products. Comparative ecosystem analyses may be the most effective, building on the first two by inferring ecosystem processes based on comparisons and contrasts of ecosystem response to human-induced factors. We propose a hierarchical system of ecosystem comparisons to include within-ecosystem comparisons (utilizing temporal and spatial changes in relation to human activities), within-ecosystem-type comparisons (e.g. coral reefs, temperate continental shelves, upwelling areas), and cross-ecosystem-type comparisons (e.g. coral reefs vs. boreal, terrestrial vs. marine ecosystems). Such a hierarchical comparative approach should lead to better understanding of the processes controlling biodiversity, productivity, and the resilience of marine ecosystems. In turn, better understanding of these processes will lead to the development of increasingly general laws, hypotheses, functional forms, governing equations, and broad interpretations of ecosystem responses to human activities, ultimately improving DSTs in support of EBM.},

abstract = {Although trophic cascades-the effect of apex predators on progressively lower trophic level species through top-down forcing-have been demonstrated in diverse ecosystems, the broader potential influences of trophic cascades on other species and ecosystem processes are not well studied. We used the overexploitation, recovery and subsequent collapse of sea otter (Enhydra lutris) populations in the Aleutian archipelago to explore if and how the abundance and diet of kelp forest fishes are influenced by a trophic cascade linking sea otters with sea urchins and fleshy macroalgae. We measured the abundance of sea urchins (biomass density), kelp (numerical density) and fish (Catch per unit effort) at four islands in the mid-1980s (when otters were abundant at two of the islands and rare at the two others) and in 2000 (after otters had become rare at all four islands). Our fish studies focused on rock greenling (Hexagrammos lagocephalus), the numerically dominant species in this region. In the mid-1980s, the two islands with high-density otter populations supported dense kelp forests, relatively few urchins, and abundant rock greenling whereas the opposite pattern (abundant urchins, sparse kelp forests, and relatively few rock greenling) occurred at islands where otters were rare. In the 2000, the abundances of urchins, kelp and greenling were grossly unchanged at islands where otters were initially rare but had shifted to the characteristic pattern of otter-free systems at islands where otters were initially abundant. Significant changes in greenling diet occurred between the mid-1980s and the 2000 although the reasons for these changes were difficult to assess because of strong island-specific effects. Whereas urchin-dominated communities supported more diverse fish assemblages than kelp-dominated communities, this was not a simple effect of the otter-induced trophic cascade because all islands supported more diverse fish assemblages in 2000 than in the mid-1980s.},

abstract = {Management strategy evaluation (MSE) involves using simulation to compare the relative effectiveness for achieving management objectives of different combinations of data collection schemes, methods of analysis and subsequent processes leading to management actions. MSE can be used to identify a ‘best' management strategy among a set of candidate strategies, or to determine how well an existing strategy performs. The ability of MSE to facilitate fisheries management achieving its aims depends on how well uncertainty is represented, and how effectively the results of simulations are summarized and presented to the decision-makers. Key challenges for effective use of MSE therefore include characterizing objectives and uncertainty, assigning plausibility ranks to the trials considered, and working with decision- makers to interpret and implement the results of the MSE. This paper explores how MSEs are conducted and characterizes current ‘best practice' guidelines, while also indicating whether and how these best practices were applied to two case- studies: the Bering–Chukchi–Beaufort Seas bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae) and the northern subpopulation of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax caerulea; Clupeidae).},

abstract = {This study examines the potential of the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) mission for monitoring the biomass and physiological condition of giant kelp forests on local to global scales. Giant kelp is a highly dynamic foundation species that supports an ecologically and economically important ecosystem found throughout the globe. Satellite, airborne, and field data are used to evaluate the suitability of HyspIRI's spatial, temporal, and spectral coverage for capturing variability in giant kelp biomass and physiological state. We analyze a 28-year time series of giant kelp biomass derived from Landsat satellite imagery in order to identify the dominant temporal modes of variability in giant kelp biomass using the California coast as a model region likely to be relevant to other regions of the globe. Temporal variability in California kelp canopy biomass is compared to the expected availability of cloud-free HyspIRI Visible Shortwave Infrared (VSWIR) views for regions of the world that contain giant kelp populations. Spectral variability is explored by assessing how changes in the physiological condition of giant kelp canopy are exhibited in the reflectance and transmittance of kelp fronds. We compare chlorophyll a to carbon ratios (Chl:C) of kelp fronds collected off the coast of California to laboratory and airborne measurements of hyperspectral reflectance in order to develop metrics of kelp physiological condition.The seasonal cycle dominates giant kelp canopy biomass temporal variability. However, the strength and timing of this cycle varies in both space and time. Our projections of cloud-free HyspIRI coverage indicate that the sensor will be able to capture at least 1 cloud free view each season for nearly all of the global giant kelp habitats, thereby illustrating that HyspIRI will resolve the dominant seasonal cycles in giant kelp biomass. A novel spectral index developed here from field observations explained 76{\%} of the variance in Chl:C and was applied to hyperspectral aircraft observations. These results demonstrate that the spatial, temporal, and spectral coverage provided by HyspIRI has the potential to provide new insights into the ecology and biophysiology of giant kelp.},

abstract = {Predation can influence the magnitude of herbivory that grazers exert on primary producers by altering both grazer abundance and their per capita consumption rates via changes in behavior, density-dependent effects, and size. Therefore, models based solely on changes in abundance may miss key components of grazing pressure. We estimated shifts in grazing pressure associated with changes in the abundance and per capita consumption rates of sea urchins triggered by size-selective predation by sea otters (Enhydra lutris). Field surveys suggest that sea otters dramatically decreased the abundance and median size of sea urchins. Furthermore, laboratory experiments revealed that kelp consumption by sea urchins varied nonlinearly as a function of urchin size such that consumption rates increased to the 0.56 and 0.68 power of biomass for red and green urchins, respectively. This reveals that shifts in urchin size structure due to size-selective predation by sea otters alter sea urchin per capita grazing rates. Comparison of two quantitative models estimating total consumptive capacity revealed that a model incorporating shifts in urchin abundance while neglecting urchin size structure overestimated grazing pressure compared to a model that incorporated size. Consequently, incorporating shifts in urchin size better predicted field estimates of kelp abundance compared to equivalent models based on urchin abundance alone. We provide strong evidence that incorporating size-specific parameters increases our ability to describe and predict trophic interactions.},

abstract = {Atlantic cod Gadus morhua stomach contents (n = 30 973, including 28 377$\backslash$nnon-empty stomachs) and morphometric measurements on live snow crab$\backslash$nChionoecetes opilio and cod were examined to assess the predator-prey$\backslash$nrelationship between these 2 species. The most common snow crab instars$\backslash$nfound in cod stomachs were III and V (similar to 6 to 8 and similar to$\backslash$n12 to 16 mm carapace width {\{}[{\}}CW], respectively) in the northern Gulf of$\backslash$nSt. Lawrence (GSL) and VI and VII (similar to 17 to 23 and similar to 23$\backslash$nto 31 mm CW, respectively) in the southern GSL. A significant positive$\backslash$nrelationship was found between cod length and the largest and smallest$\backslash$nCW of snow crab ingested by cod. Positive relationships were also found$\backslash$nbetween gape width and body length in cod and between 3 measures of size$\backslash$n(maximum span, width at rest, length at rest) and CW in snow crab. Snow$\backslash$ncrab length at rest was closely related to cod gape width, suggesting$\backslash$nthat the largest snow crab ingested by cod must be attacked from the$\backslash$nside. There appears to be a plateau at 65.1 mm in the relationship$\backslash$nbetween maximum snow crab CW and cod length, caused by the absence of$\backslash$nlarge (adolescent and adult) male snow crab in cod stomachs. Other$\backslash$nstudies have found recently moulted, soft-shell snow crabs in cod$\backslash$nstomachs, but this appears to be rare. Thus, snow crabs are susceptible$\backslash$nto predation by cod mostly for the first 4 yr of postsettlement in the$\backslash$nGSL. Any effect of cod predation on the snowcrab fishery would be felt 6$\backslash$nto 11 yr later, given growth models established for the GSL.},

abstract = {Suitability coefficients are important for the estimation of predation mortality in a multispecies virtual population analysis (MSVPA) and subsequent use in the multispecies forecasting model (MSFOR). Testing the assumption of the stability of the suitability coefficients is important in assessing the robustness of the predictions made with MSFOR. We used different statistical methods to partially test this assumption for the eastern Bering Sea MSVPA model with eight species, using stomach content data for the years 1985-1989. Comparison of the estimates from two different sets of stomach content data (set one with all data and set two mainly with data from 1985) suggested that the differences between the two types of estimates were much reduced when the number of predator stomachs sampled increased. In a second approach, we contrasted the residual variances of partial data sets with the results from the fit of the total data set. Results suggested a small increase (???10.8{\%}) in the variation of the suitability coefficients. Comparison of the means of the suitability coefficients associated with each predator species suggests that only 13 of the 50 possible pairwise contrasts were significantly different (?? = 0.05). In general, results suggested that the predator preferences and prey vulnerabilities remained stable over the time period studied. Therefore, MSFOR could be considered as a tool to advise fisheries managers within a multispecies context. ?? 2005 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Nonlinearity is important and ubiquitous in ecology. Though detectable in principle, nonlinear behavior is often difficult to characterize, analyze, and incorporate mechanistically into models of ecosystem function. One obvious reason is that quantitative nonlinear analysis tools are data intensive (require long time series), and time series in ecology are generally short. Here we demonstrate a useful method that circumvents data limitation and reduces sampling error by combining ecologically similar multispecies time series into one long time series. With this technique, individual ecological time series containing as few as 20 data points can be mined for such important information as (1) significantly improved forecast ability, (2) the presence and location of nonlinearity, and (3) the effective dimensionality (the number of relevant variables) of an ecological system.},
